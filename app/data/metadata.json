Specifically, we project high dimensional E.H.R. data to a closed unit ball of low dimension, encoding geometric priors so that the origin represents an idealized perfect health state and the euclidean norm is associated with the patient's mortality risk. Moreover, using septic patients as an example, we show how we could learn to associate the angle between two vectors with the different organ system failures, thereby, learning a compact representation which is indicative of both mortality risk and specific organ failure. We show how the learned embedding can be used for online patient monitoring, supplement clinicians and improve performance of downstream machine learning tasks. This work was partially motivated from the desire and the need to introduce a systematic way of defining intermediate rewards for Reinforcement Learning in critical care medicine. Hence, we also show how such a design in terms of the learned embedding can result in qualitatively different policies and value distributions, as compared with using only terminal rewards."

The difficulty of this task is exacerbated in low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests. Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low- and middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray images, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent classification using machine learning methods that do not require large computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14 individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50 for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively. The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine."

In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, Mime, which i) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts arbitrary centralized optimization algorithms such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning setting. Mime uses a combination of control-variates and server-level statistics (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each local update mimics that of the centralized method run on iid data. We prove a reduction result showing that Mime can translate the convergence of a generic algorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting. Further, we show that when combined with momentum based variance reduction, Mime is provably faster than any centralized method--the first such result. We also perform a thorough experimental exploration of Mime's performance on real world datasets."

In semi-supervised learning, we use the predictions of a max-margin classifier as the missing labels instead of performing full posterior inference for efficiency; we also introduce additional max-margin and label-balance regularization terms of unlabeled data for effectiveness. We develop an efficient doubly stochastic subgradient algorithm for the piecewise linear objectives in different settings. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate that: (1) max-margin learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of DGMs and meanwhile retain the generative ability; (2) in supervised learning, mmDGMs are competitive to the best fully discriminative networks when employing convolutional neural networks as the generative and recognition models; and (3) in semi-supervised learning, mmDCGMs can perform efficient inference and achieve state-of-the-art classification results on several benchmarks."

In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities). To encourage each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes, the clustering is carried out by learning discrete representations that best describe the future outcome distribution based on novel loss functions.

By making this simple but critical modification, we achieve a dramatic speedup for the 4-bit PQ on an ARM architecture.

However, they can be challenging to work with as data is often sparse and irregularly sampled. One approach to solve these limitations is learning dense embeddings that represent individual patient trajectories using a recurrent neural network autoencoder (RNN-AE). This process can be susceptible to unwanted data biases. We show that patient embeddings and clusters using previously proposed RNN-AE models might be impacted by a trajectory bias, meaning that results are dominated by the amount of data contained in each patients trajectory, instead of clinically relevant details. We investigate this bias on 2 datasets (from different hospitals) and 2 disease areas as well as using different parts of the patient trajectory. Our results using 2 previously published baseline methods indicate a particularly strong bias in case of an event-to-end trajectory. We present a method that can overcome this issue using an adversarial training scheme on top of a RNN-AE. Our results show that our approach can reduce the trajectory bias in all cases."

Due to the explicit mathematical principle and intelligent nature to accommodate conditions, adaptive filters with different types of implementations are always used for AEC, giving considerable performance. However, there would be some kinds of residual echo in the results, including linear residue introduced by mismatching between estimation and the reality and non-linear residue mostly caused by non-linear components on the audio devices. The linear residue can be reduced with elaborate structure and methods, leaving the non-linear residue intractable for suppression. Though, some non-linear processing methods have already be raised, they are complicated and inefficient for suppression, and would bring damage to the speech audio. In this paper, a fusion scheme by combining adaptive filter and neural network is proposed for AEC. The echo could be reduced in a large scale by adaptive filtering, resulting in little residual echo. Though it is much smaller than speech audio, it could also be perceived by human ear and would make communication annoy. The neural network is elaborately designed and trained for suppressing such residual echo. Experiments compared with prevailing methods are conducted, validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed combination scheme."

This demands learning models that capture relevant motion patterns, while offering enough flexibility to adapt the encoded skills to new requirements, such as dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduce a Riemannian manifold perspective on this problem, and propose to learn a Riemannian manifold from human demonstrations on which geodesics are natural motion skills. We realize this with a variational autoencoder (VAE) over the space of position and orientations of the robot end-effector. Geodesic motion skills let a robot plan movements from and to arbitrary points on the data manifold. They also provide a straightforward method to avoid obstacles by redefining the ambient metric in an online fashion. Moreover, geodesics naturally exploit the manifold resulting from multiple--mode tasks to design motions that were not explicitly demonstrated previously. We test our learning framework using a 7-DoF robotic manipulator, where the robot satisfactorily learns and reproduces realistic skills featuring elaborated motion patterns, avoids previously unseen obstacles, and generates novel movements in multiple-mode settings."

Our model circumvents the inherent difficulty of unsupervised signal disaggregation by using both the shape of a power spike and its time of occurrence to identify the contribution of CWH reliably. Indeed, many CHWs in France are configured to turn on automatically during off-peak hours only, and we are able to use this domain knowledge to aid peak identification despite the low sampling frequency. In order to test our model, we equipped a home with sensors to record the ground-truth consumption of a water heater. We then apply the model to a larger dataset of energy consumption of Hello Watt users consisting of one month of consumption data for 5k homes at 30-minute resolution. In this dataset we successfully identified CWHs in the majority of cases where consumers declared using them. The remaining part is likely due to possible misconfiguration of CWHs, since triggering them during off-peak hours requires specific wiring in the electrical panel of the house. Our model, despite its simplicity, offers promising applications: detection of mis-configured CWHs on off-peak contracts and slow performance degradation."

Our approach first uses lightweight source code analysis to generate a program abstraction called a type dependency graph, which links type variables with logical constraints as well as name and usage information. Given this program abstraction, we then use a graph neural network to propagate information between related type variables and eventually make type predictions. Our neural architecture can predict both standard types, like number or string, as well as user-defined types that have not been encountered during training.

To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, an IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the datasets are private and IoTDs may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighbor IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require sharing the datasets between the IoTDs, thus, it can be implemented in IoTs that preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring systems or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that, the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS."

Combining these approaches, we introduce Dynamical Components Analysis (DCA), a linear dimensionality reduction method which discovers a subspace of high-dimensional time series data with maximal predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and future. We test DCA on synthetic examples and demonstrate its superior ability to extract dynamical structure compared to commonly used linear methods. We also apply DCA to several real-world datasets, showing that the dimensions extracted by DCA are more useful than those extracted by other methods for predicting future states and decoding auxiliary variables. Overall, DCA robustly extracts dynamical structure in noisy, high-dimensional data while retaining the computational efficiency and geometric interpretability of linear dimensionality reduction methods."

In this paper, we first propose a new task named \"Outline to Story\" (O2S) as a test bed for fine-grained controllable generation of long text, which generates a multi-paragraph story from cascaded events, i.e. a sequence of outline events that guide subsequent paragraph generation. We then create dedicate datasets for future benchmarks, built by state-of-the-art keyword extraction techniques. Finally, we propose an extremely simple yet strong baseline method for the O2S task, which fine tunes pre-trained language models on augmented sequences of outline-story pairs with simple language modeling objective. Our method does not introduce any new parameters or perform any architecture modification, except several special tokens as delimiters to build augmented sequences.

To leverage the NCM classifier more effectively, data embeddings belonging to the same class should be clustered and well-separated from those with a different class label. To this end, we contribute Supervised Contrastive Replay (SCR), which explicitly encourages samples from the same class to cluster tightly in embedding space while pushing those of different classes further apart during replay-based training. Overall, we observe that our proposed SCR substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting and outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods by a significant margin on a variety of datasets."

By estimating how much information an algorithm can memorize from a dataset, we can set a lower bound on the amount of performance due to other factors such as generalization and luck. With this goal in mind, we introduce the Labeling Distribution Matrix (LDM) as a tool for estimating the capacity of learning algorithms. The method attempts to characterize the diversity of possible outputs by an algorithm for different training datasets, using this to measure algorithm flexibility and responsiveness to data. We test the method on several supervised learning algorithms, and find that while the results are not conclusive, the LDM does allow us to gain potentially valuable insight into the prediction behavior of algorithms. We also introduce the Label Recorder as an additional tool for estimating algorithm capacity, with more promising initial results."

        "abstract_text": "Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge. Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) replicability - whether the reported experimental result can be approximately reproduced in high probability with the same DL model and the same data; and (2) reproducibility - whether one reported experimental findings can be reproduced by new experiments with the same experimental protocol and DL model, but different sampled real-world data. Unlike traditional machine learning (ML) models, DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the time-consuming optimization process. In this study, we conducted a literature review on 93 DL studies recently published in twenty SE journals or conferences. Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE. Moreover, we re-ran four representative DL models in SE. Experimental results show the importance of replicability and reproducibility, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be replicated for an unstable optimization process. Reproducibility could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data."

However, in many cases we wish to train these generative models to optimize some auxiliary objective function within the data it generates, such as making more aesthetically pleasing images. In some cases, these objective functions are difficult to evaluate, e.g. they may require human interaction. Here, we develop a system for efficiently improving a GAN to target an objective involving human interaction, specifically generating images that increase rates of positive user interactions. To improve the generative model, we build a model of human behavior in the targeted domain from a relatively small set of interactions, and then use this behavioral model as an auxiliary loss function to improve the generative model. We show that this system is successful at improving positive interaction rates, at least on simulated data, and characterize some of the factors that affect its performance."

This article presents DAMNED, a large scale SNN simulation framework able to gather the benefits of EDS and parallel computing.

We provide a graph embedding view of the problem which can then be solved efficiently using the spectral regression approach. In this sense, unlike previous similar methods which often require costly eigen-computations of dense matrices, the proposed approach casts the problem under consideration into a regression framework which is computationally more efficient. In particular, it is shown that the dominant complexity of the proposed method is the complexity of computing the kernel matrix. Additional appealing characteristics of the proposed one-class classifier are: 1-the ability to be trained in an incremental fashion (allowing for application in streaming data scenarios while also reducing the computational complexity in a non-streaming operation mode); 2-being unsupervised, but providing the option for refining the solution using negative training examples, when available; And last but not the least, 3-the use of the kernel trick which facilitates a nonlinear mapping of the data into a high-dimensional feature space to seek better solutions."

Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for designing machine learning systems.

In this problem, the transmitter has to choose the transmit power based on the amount of stored energy in its battery with the goal of maximizing the average rate obtained over time. We model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the transmitter as the agent, the battery status as the state, the transmit power as the action and the rate obtained as the reward. The average reward maximization problem over the MDP can be solved by a linear program (LP) that uses the transition probabilities for the state-action pairs and their reward values to choose a power allocation policy. Since the rewards associated the state-action pairs are unknown, we propose two online learning algorithms: UCLP and Epoch-UCLP that learn these rewards and adapt their policies along the way. The UCLP algorithm solves the LP at each step to decide its current policy using the upper confidence bounds on the rewards, while the Epoch-UCLP algorithm divides the time into epochs, solves the LP only at the beginning of the epochs and follows the obtained policy in that epoch. We prove that the reward losses or regrets incurred by both these algorithms are upper bounded by constants. Epoch-UCLP incurs a higher regret compared to UCLP, but reduces the computational requirements substantially. We also show that the presented algorithms work for online learning in cost minimization problems like the packet scheduling with power-delay tradeoff with minor changes."

Our method works by dynamically updating the learning rate during optimization using the gradient with respect to the learning rate of the update rule itself.

In this work, we extend their method with a re-parameterization technique that allows us to learn hyperbolic embeddings of arbitrarily parameterized objects. We apply this framework to learn word and sentence embeddings in hyperbolic space in an unsupervised manner from text corpora. The resulting embeddings seem to encode certain intuitive notions of hierarchy, such as word-context frequency and phrase constituency. However, the implicit continuous hierarchy in the learned hyperbolic space makes interrogating the model's learned hierarchies more difficult than for models that learn explicit edges between items.

In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the downstream classifiers. We also show the effectiveness of BadEncoder using two publicly available, real-world image encoders, i.e., Google's image encoder pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI's Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet.

However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected, and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are processed jointly within a multiple instance learning framework, mitigating their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. Moreover, we demonstrate how real annotations drawn by pathologists can be efficiently refined and improved by the proposed approach. All these results demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, light-weight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from coarsely annotated pathology sets."

In order to accurately estimate such treatment effects, one typically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments. Currently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is often confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data is confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually too small to learn heterogeneous treatment effects. In this paper, we propose to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining large amounts of observational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation learning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: first, we use observational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation); and then, we use randomized data to learn the data-specific structures. We analyze the finite sample properties of our framework and compare them to several natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining observational and randomized data is beneficial, and for when it is not. Based on this, we introduce a sample-efficient algorithm, called CorNet. We use extensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method's superiority compared to existing methods."

The MET of non-communicable diseases like diabetes is highly correlated to cumulative health conditions, more specifically, how much time the patient spent with specific health conditions in the past. The common time-series representation is indirect in extracting such information from EHR because it focuses on detailed dependencies between values in successive observations, not cumulative information. We propose a novel data representation for EHR called cumulative stay-time representation (CTR), which directly models such cumulative health conditions. We derive a trainable construction of CTR based on neural networks that has the flexibility to fit the target data and scalability to handle high-dimensional EHR. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CTR alone achieves a high prediction performance, and it enhances the performance of existing models when combined with them."

The vast majority of the domain adaptation methods tackle single-source case, where the model trained on a single source domain is adapted to a target domain. However, these methods have limited practical real world applications, since usually one has multiple source domains with different data distributions. In this work, we deal with the multi-source domain adaptation problem. Our method, namely StandardGAN, standardizes each source and target domains so that all the data have similar data distributions. We then use the standardized source domains to train a classifier and segment the standardized target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on two remote sensing data sets, in which the first one consists of multiple cities from a single country, and the other one contains multiple cities from different countries. Our experimental results show that the standardized data generated by StandardGAN allow the classifiers to generate significantly better segmentation."

Thus, we propose a Black-box Reachability-based Safety Layer (BRSL) with three main components: (1) data-driven reachability analysis for a black-box robot model, (2) a trajectory rollout planner that predicts future actions and observations using an ensemble of neural networks trained online, and (3) a differentiable polytope collision check between the reachable set and obstacles that enables correcting unsafe actions. In simulation, BRSL outperforms other state-of-the-art safe RL methods on a Turtlebot 3, a quadrotor, and a trajectory-tracking point mass with an unsafe set adjacent to the area of highest reward."

In the previous studies, however, a major assumption accepted by default, is that the training and testing data are taking from same feature distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption is mostly invalid in real application, resulting in a certain lack of applicability for the traditional diagnosis approaches. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning that leverages the knowledge learnt from rich labeled data in source domain to facilitate diagnosing a new but similar target task, a new intelligent fault diagnosis framework, i.e., deep transfer network (DTN), which generalizes deep learning model to domain adaptation scenario, is proposed in this paper. By extending the marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) to joint distribution adaptation (JDA), the proposed framework can exploit the discrimination structures associated with the labeled data in source domain to adapt the conditional distribution of unlabeled target data, and thus guarantee a more accurate distribution matching. Extensive empirical evaluations on three fault datasets validate the applicability and practicability of DTN, while achieving many state-of-the-art transfer results in terms of diverse operating conditions, fault severities and fault types."

It is often detrimental in cutting operations causing a poor surface finish and decreased tool life. Therefore, chatter detection using machine learning has been an active research area over the last decade. Three challenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection at large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of chatter features across different processes, the need for automating feature extraction, and the existence of limited data for each specific workpiece-machine tool combination. These three challenges can be grouped under the umbrella of transfer learning. This paper studies automating chatter detection by evaluating transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter detection methods. We investigate chatter classification accuracy using a variety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments with different cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Auto-correlation Function (ACF), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). We also examine more recent approaches based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and similarity measures of time series based on Discrete Time Warping (DTW). We evaluate the transfer learning potential of each approach by training and testing both within and across the turning and milling data sets. Our results show that carefully chosen time-frequency features can lead to high classification accuracies albeit at the cost of requiring manual pre-processing and the tagging of an expert user."

Network embedding has been proved as an effective method to convert information networks into lower-dimensional space, whereas the core information can be well preserved. However, traditional network embedding algorithms are sub-optimal in capturing rich while potentially incompatible semantics provided by HINs. To address this issue, a novel meta-path-based HIN representation learning framework named mSHINE is designed to simultaneously learn multiple node representations for different meta-paths. More specifically, one representation learning module inspired by the RNN structure is developed and multiple node representations can be learned simultaneously, where each representation is associated with one respective meta-path. By measuring the relevance between nodes with the designed objective function, the learned module can be applied in downstream link prediction tasks. A set of criteria for selecting initial meta-paths is proposed as the other module in mSHINE which is important to reduce the optimal meta-path selection cost when no prior knowledge of suitable meta-paths is available. To corroborate the effectiveness of mSHINE, extensive experimental studies including node classification and link prediction are conducted on five real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that mSHINE outperforms other state-of-the-art HIN embedding methods."

        "abstract_text": "Trajectory prediction has always been a challenging problem for autonomous driving, since it needs to infer the latent intention from the behaviors and interactions from traffic participants. This problem is intrinsically hard, because each participant may behave differently under different environments and interactions. This key is to effectively model the interlaced influence from both spatial context and temporal context. Existing work usually encodes these two types of context separately, which would lead to inferior modeling of the scenarios. In this paper, we first propose a unified approach to treat time and space dimensions equally for modeling spatio-temporal context. The proposed module is simple and easy to implement within several lines of codes. In contrast to existing methods which heavily rely on recurrent neural network for temporal context and hand-crafted structure for spatial context, our method could automatically partition the spatio-temporal space to adapt the data. Lastly, we test our proposed framework on two recently proposed trajectory prediction dataset ApolloScape and Argoverse. We show that the proposed method substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining its simplicity.

The input to the network X, here text or census data, produces a prediction Y, such as an analogy completion or income bracket, while the adversary tries to model a protected variable Z, here gender or zip code. The objective is to maximize the predictor's ability to predict Y while minimizing the adversary's ability to predict Z. Applied to analogy completion, this method results in accurate predictions that exhibit less evidence of stereotyping Z. When applied to a classification task using the UCI Adult (Census) Dataset, it results in a predictive model that does not lose much accuracy while achieving very close to equality of odds (Hardt, et al., 2016). The method is flexible and applicable to multiple definitions of fairness as well as a wide range of gradient-based learning models, including both regression and classification tasks."

So far in the literature the VC Dimension has only been used to approximate the generalization error bounds on different Neural Network architectures. VC Dimension has not yet been implicitly or explicitly stated to fix the network size which is important as the wrong configuration could lead to high computation effort in training and leads to over fitting. So there is a need to bound these units so that task can be computed with only sufficient number of parameters. For binary classification tasks shallow networks are used as they have universal approximation property and it is enough to size the hidden layer width for such networks. The paper brings out a theoretical justification on required attribute size and its corresponding hidden layer dimension for a given sample set that gives an optimal binary classification results with minimum training complexity in a single layered feed forward network framework. The paper also establishes proof on the existence of bounds on the width of the hidden layer and its range subjected to certain conditions.

Further, in applications with seasonal data, temporal concept drift is confounded by seasonal variation.

The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic graphs create a lot of small trees that are connected to the core of the graph by only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy `dangling sets'. Spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the paper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering and shows that it is related to the graph conductance on a `regularized graph'. We call the conductance on the regularized graph CoreCut. Based upon previous arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering. Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to small cuts in the graph. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from spectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery of a sparse and stochastic graph. Regularization fixes this overfitting. In addition to this statistical benefit, these results also demonstrate how regularization can improve the computational speed of spectral clustering. We provide simulations and data examples to illustrate these results."

Nonetheless, detecting tumors with a high sensitivity rate and reducing the false positives rate is still challenging.

We demonstrate that searching is non-optimal since the domain of motifs is restricted, and instead we propose a principled optimization approach able to find optimal motifs. We treat the occurrence frequency as a function and time-series motifs as its parameters, therefore we \\textit{learn} the optimal motifs that maximize the frequency function. In contrast to searching, our method is able to discover the most repetitive patterns (hence optimal), even in cases where they do not explicitly occur as sub-sequences. Experiments on several real-life time-series datasets show that the motifs found by our method are highly more frequent than the ones found through searching, for exactly the same distance threshold."

Neural networks (NNs) have been demonstrated to work well at the core of model-based optimization procedures and here we extend them to handle these censored observations. We propose (i)~a loss function based on the Tobit model to incorporate censored samples into training and (ii) use an ensemble of networks to model the posterior distribution.

However, acquiring high-quality translation pairs requires expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, how to best utilize a given dataset of samples with diverse quality and characteristics becomes an important yet understudied question in NMT. Curriculum learning methods have been introduced to NMT to optimize a model's performance by prescribing the data input order, based on heuristics such as the assessment of noise and difficulty levels. However, existing methods require training from scratch, while in practice most NMT models are pre-trained on big data already. Moreover, as heuristics, they do not generalize well. In this paper, we aim to learn a curriculum for improving a pre-trained NMT model by re-selecting influential data samples from the original training set and formulate this task as a reinforcement learning problem. Specifically, we propose a data selection framework based on Deterministic Actor-Critic, in which a critic network predicts the expected change of model performance due to a certain sample, while an actor network learns to select the best sample out of a random batch of samples presented to it. Experiments on several translation datasets show that our method can further improve the performance of NMT when original batch training reaches its ceiling, without using additional new training data, and significantly outperforms several strong baseline methods."

The two-step approach often leads to information loss and unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution based on the deep neural networks for temporal sets prediction. A unique perspective of our approach is to learn element relationship by constructing set-level co-occurrence graph and then perform graph convolutions on the dynamic relationship graphs. Moreover, we design an attention-based module to adaptively learn the temporal dependency of elements and sets. Finally, we provide a gated updating mechanism to find the hidden shared patterns in different sequences and fuse both static and dynamic information to improve the prediction performance.

Our approach uses a Bayesian framework to define a latent attention map that links frames of the input and target utterances. We train a masked convolutional encoder-decoder network to produce this attention map via a stochastic version of the mean absolute error loss function; our model also predicts the length of the target speech signal using the encoder embeddings. The predicted length determines the number of steps for the decoder operation. During inference, we generate the attention map as a proxy for the similarity matrix between the given input speech and an unknown target speech signal. Using this similarity matrix, we compute a warping path of alignment between the two signals. Our experiments demonstrate that this adaptive framework produces similar results to dynamic time warping, which relies on a known target signal, on both voice conversion and emotion conversion tasks. We also show that our technique results in a high quality of generated speech that is on par with state-of-the-art vocoders."

A reliable prediction of the future environment, including the behavior of dynamic agents, would allow planning algorithms to proactively generate a trajectory in response to a rapidly changing environment. We present a novel framework that predicts the future occupancy state of the local environment surrounding an autonomous agent by learning a motion model from occupancy grid data using a neural network. We take advantage of the temporal structure of the grid data by utilizing a convolutional long-short term memory network in the form of the PredNet architecture.

If the signal has a characteristic timescale relevant to future prediction, the memory can be a simple shift register---a moving window extending into the past, requiring storage resources that linearly grows with the timescale to be represented. However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the characteristic prediction-relevant timescale of the signal. Moreover, many naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale allowed by resource availability. Here we construct a fuzzy memory system that optimally sacrifices the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free fashion in order to represent prediction-relevant information from exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in time series forecasting of natural signals. When the available storage resources are limited, we suggest that a general purpose learner would be better off committing to such a fuzzy memory system."

We consider an MCMC where each step samples from a Gaussian whose mean and covariance matrix depend on the previous state, defines through its asymptotic distribution a target density. First, we show that good choices (in the sense of consistency) for these mean and covariance functions are the local expected value and local covariance under that target density. Then we show that an auto-encoder with a contractive penalty captures estimators of these local moments in its reconstruction function and its Jacobian. A contribution of this work is thus a novel alternative to maximum-likelihood density estimation, which we call local moment matching. It also justifies a recently proposed sampling algorithm for the Contractive Auto-Encoder and extends it to the Denoising Auto-Encoder."

We define a family of optimization problems, which we call Quasi-Concave Promise Problems, that generalizes some of our considered tasks. We observe that a quasi-concave promise problem can be privately approximated using a solution to a smaller instance of a quasi-concave promise problem. This allows us to construct an efficient recursive algorithm solving such problems privately. Specifically, we construct private learners for point functions, threshold functions, and axis-aligned rectangles in high dimension. Similarly, we construct sanitizers for point functions and threshold functions. We also examine the sample complexity of label-private learners, a relaxation of private learning where the learner is required to only protect the privacy of the labels in the sample.

A key open question for this type of work, especially for applications where inconsistency with human behavior can lead to ethical lapses, is how to evaluate the epistemic uncertainty of trained predictors, i.e., the uncertainty that comes from the predictor's model. We propose a Bayesian framework for evaluating black box predictors in this regime, agnostic to the predictor's internal structure. The framework specifies how to estimate the epistemic uncertainty that comes from the predictor with respect to human labels by approximating a conditional distribution and producing a credible interval for the predictions and their measures of performance. The framework is successfully applied to four image classification tasks that use subjective human judgements: facial beauty assessment, social attribute assignment, apparent age estimation, and ambiguous scene labeling."

Methods: In this study, a deep learning model that detects COVID-19 cases with high performance is presented. The proposed method is defined as Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and can automatically classify Computed Tomography (CT) images. Unlike the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained with the transfer learning method, the CSVM model is trained as a scratch. To evaluate the performance of the CSVM method, the dataset is divided into two parts as training (%75) and testing (%25). The CSVM model consists of blocks containing three different numbers of SVM kernels. Results: When the performance of pre-trained CNN networks and CSVM models is assessed, CSVM (7x7, 3x3, 1x1) model shows the highest performance with 94.03% ACC, 96.09% SEN, 92.01% SPE, 92.19% PRE, 94.10% F1-Score, 88.15% MCC and 88.07% Kappa metric values.

In recent years, anomaly detection algorithms are mostly based on deep-learning generative models and use the reconstruction error to detect anomalies. They try to capture the distribution of normal data by reconstructing normal data in the training phase, then calculate the reconstruction error of test data to do anomaly detection. However, most of them only use the normal data in the training phase and can not ensure the reconstruction process of anomaly data. So, anomaly data can also be well reconstructed sometimes and gets low reconstruction error, which leads to the omission of anomalies. What's more, the neighbor information of data points in time series data has not been fully utilized in these algorithms. In this paper, we propose RAN based on the idea of Reconstruct Anomalies to Normal and apply it for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. To minimize the reconstruction error of normal data and maximize this of anomaly data, we do not just ensure normal data to reconstruct well, but also try to make the reconstruction of anomaly data consistent with the distribution of normal data, then anomalies will get higher reconstruction errors. We implement this idea by introducing the \"imitated anomaly data\" and combining a specially designed latent vector-constrained Autoencoder with the discriminator to construct an adversary network. Extensive experiments on time-series datasets from different scenes such as ECG diagnosis also show that RAN can detect meaningful anomalies, and it outperforms other algorithms in terms of AUC-ROC."

This study presents a neural network model that can predict storm surge, informed by a database of synthetic storm simulations. This model can serve as a fast and affordable emulator for the very expensive CFD solvers. The neural network model is trained with the storm track parameters used to drive the CFD solvers, and the output of the model is the time-series evolution of the predicted storm surge across multiple nodes within the spatial domain of interest. Once the model is trained, it can be deployed for further predictions based on new storm track inputs. The developed neural network model is a time-series model, a Long short-term memory, a variation of Recurrent Neural Network, which is enriched with Convolutional Neural Networks. The convolutional neural network is employed to capture the correlation of data spatially. Therefore, the temporal and spatial correlations of data are captured by the combination of the mentioned models, the ConvLSTM model.

Importantly, edits that are not necessary to flip the applicable label are prohibited. Models trained on the augmented data appear, empirically, to rely less on semantically irrelevant words and to generalize better out of domain. While this work draws loosely on causal thinking, the underlying causal model (even at an abstract level) and the principles underlying the observed out-of-domain improvements remain unclear. In this paper, we introduce a toy analog based on linear Gaussian models, observing interesting relationships between causal models, measurement noise, out-of-domain generalization, and reliance on spurious signals. Our analysis provides some insights that help to explain the efficacy of CAD. Moreover, we develop the hypothesis that while adding noise to causal features should degrade both in-domain and out-of-domain performance, adding noise to non-causal features should lead to relative improvements in out-of-domain performance. This idea inspires a speculative test for determining whether a feature attribution technique has identified the causal spans. If adding noise (e.g., by random word flips) to the highlighted spans degrades both in-domain and out-of-domain performance on a battery of challenge datasets, but adding noise to the complement gives improvements out-of-domain, it suggests we have identified causal spans."

On the other hand, Gradient Coding (GC) has been recently proposed to mitigate stragglers in a master-worker topology by allowing carefully designed redundant allocation of the data set to the workers. We propose a joint communication topology design and data set allocation strategy, named CodedReduce (CR), that combines the best of both RAR and GC. That is, it parallelizes the communications over a tree topology leading to efficient bandwidth utilization, and carefully designs a redundant data set allocation and coding strategy at the nodes to make the proposed gradient aggregation scheme robust to stragglers. In particular, we quantify the communication parallelization gain and resiliency of the proposed CR scheme, and prove its optimality when the communication topology is a regular tree. Moreover, we characterize the expected run-time of CR and show order-wise speedups compared to the benchmark schemes.

In contrast with current solutions mainly based on static and on-ground radars, this paper proposes the idea of a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. To this end, we describe a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. Such information is shared by the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints. Our results show how a dynamic network of radars attains better localization results compared to a fixed configuration and how the on-board sensor technology impacts the accuracy in tracking a target with different radar cross sections, especially in non line-of-sight (NLOS) situations."

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an energy based model that is very feasible for being trained to represent a data distribution and also for performing Gibbs sampling. We used RBM to capture data distribution of the source domain and use it in order to cast target instances into new data with a distribution similar to the distribution of source data. Using datasets that are commonly used for evaluation of TL methods, we show that our method can successfully enhance target classification by a considerable ratio. Additionally, the proposed method has the advantage over common DA methods that it needs no target data during the process of training of models."

        "abstract_text": "Computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix is a core problem with practical applications ranging from target tracking to statistical thermodynamics. However, this problem is also #P-complete, which leaves little hope for finding an exact solution that can be computed efficiently. While the problem admits a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme, this method has seen little use because it is both inefficient in practice and difficult to implement. We present AdaPart, a simple and efficient method for drawing exact samples from an unnormalized distribution. Using AdaPart, we show how to construct tight bounds on the permanent which hold with high probability, with guaranteed polynomial runtime for dense matrices. We find that AdaPart can provide empirical speedups exceeding 25x over prior sampling methods on matrices that are challenging for variational based approaches. Finally, in the context of multi-target tracking, exact sampling from the distribution defined by the matrix permanent allows us to use the optimal proposal distribution during particle filtering. Using AdaPart, we show that this leads to improved tracking performance using an order of magnitude fewer samples."

Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real world applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently, with the advances of deep learning techniques, deep leaning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have enjoyed considerable success in various machine learning tasks due to their powerful hierarchical feature learning ability in both spatial and temporal domains, and have been widely applied in various spatio-temporal data mining (STDM) tasks such as predictive learning, representation learning, anomaly detection and classification. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress in applying deep learning techniques for STDM. We first categorize the types of spatio-temporal data and briefly introduce the popular deep learning models that are used in STDM. Then a framework is introduced to show a general pipeline of the utilization of deep learning models for STDM. Next we classify existing literatures based on the types of ST data, the data mining tasks, and the deep learning models, followed by the applications of deep learning for STDM in different domains including transportation, climate science, human mobility, location based social network, crime analysis, and neuroscience."

However, at low bitrates, audio quality, especially for speech, degrades drastically due to the lack of available bits to directly code the transform coefficients. Traditionally, post-filtering has been used to mitigate artefacts in the coded speech by exploiting a-priori information of the source and extra transmitted parameters. Recently, data-driven post-filters have shown better results, but at the cost of significant additional complexity and delay. In this work, we propose a mask-based post-filter operating directly in MDCT domain of the codec, inducing no extra delay. The real-valued mask is applied to the quantized MDCT coefficients and is estimated from a relatively lightweight convolutional encoder-decoder network. Our solution is tested on the recently standardized low-delay, low-complexity codec (LC3) at lowest possible bitrate of 16 kbps. Objective and subjective assessments clearly show the advantage of this approach over the conventional post-filter, with an average improvement of 10 MUSHRA points over the LC3 coded speech."

However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

It compares graph convolutional networks using different graph representations in the task of program embedding. It shows that the sparsity of control flow graphs and the implicit aggregation of graph convolutional networks cause these models to perform worse than naive models.

However, real-world data may display structures that can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers. Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art results considerably."

Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input complexity.

As an application, we implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system's behavior. Our experience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn program semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion."

Algorithms that can accurately predict which links are missing can dramatically speedup the collection of network data and improve the validity of network models. Many algorithms now exist for predicting missing links, given a partially observed network, but it has remained unknown whether a single best predictor exists, how link predictability varies across methods and networks from different domains, and how close to optimality current methods are. We answer these questions by systematically evaluating 203 individual link predictor algorithms, representing three popular families of methods, applied to a large corpus of 548 structurally diverse networks from six scientific domains. We first show that individual algorithms exhibit a broad diversity of prediction errors, such that no one predictor or family is best, or worst, across all realistic inputs. We then exploit this diversity via meta-learning to construct a series of \"stacked\" models that combine predictors into a single algorithm. Applied to a broad range of synthetic networks, for which we may analytically calculate optimal performance, these stacked models achieve optimal or nearly optimal levels of accuracy. Applied to real-world networks, stacked models are also superior, but their accuracy varies strongly by domain, suggesting that link prediction may be fundamentally easier in social networks than in biological or technological networks. These results indicate that the state-of-the-art for link prediction comes from combining individual algorithms, which achieves nearly optimal predictions. We close with a brief discussion of limitations and opportunities for further improvement of these results."

In this paper, we demonstrate that this regularization does not encourage a broad distribution of spectral-values in the discriminator weights, hence resulting in less fidelity in the learned distribution. We therefore investigate the possibility of substituting this Lipschitz constraint with an orthogonality constraint on the weight matrices. We compare three different weight orthogonalization techniques with regards to their convergence properties, their ability to ensure the Lipschitz condition and the achieved quality of the learned distribution. In addition, we provide a comparison to Wasserstein-GANs trained with current state-of-the-art methods, where we demonstrate the potential of solely using orthogonality-based regularization. In this context, we propose an improved training procedure for Wasserstein-GANs which utilizes orthogonalization to further increase its generalization capability.

Even more, such behavior is impacted by various elements of the learning problem, including the size and quality of training data, specific forms of adversarial perturbations in the input, model overparameterization, and adversary's power, among others. In this paper, we focus on \\emph{distribution perturbing} adversary framework wherein the adversary can change the test distribution within a neighborhood of the training data distribution. The neighborhood is defined via Wasserstein distance between distributions and the radius of the neighborhood is a measure of adversary's manipulative power. We study the tradeoff between standard risk and adversarial risk and derive the Pareto-optimal tradeoff, achievable over specific classes of models, in the infinite data limit with features dimension kept fixed. We consider three learning settings: 1) Regression with the class of linear models; 2) Binary classification under the Gaussian mixtures data model, with the class of linear classifiers; 3) Regression with the class of random features model (which can be equivalently represented as two-layer neural network with random first-layer weights).

For two-layer ReLU neural networks, we prove that these two conditions do in fact hold throughout the training, under the assumptions of nondegenerate inputs and overparameterization.

However, the meta-learner is prone to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be identified as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Moreover, when handling the data with noisy labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label noise on a corrupted dataset. To address these two challenges, we present Eigen-Reptile (ER) that updates the meta-parameters with the main direction of historical task-specific parameters to alleviate sampling and label noise. Specifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of the calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps instead of the number of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main direction for Eigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose Introspective Self-paced Learning (ISPL). We have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed Eigen-Reptile and ISPL. Particularly, our experiments on different tasks show that the proposed method is able to outperform or achieve highly competitive performance compared with other gradient-based methods with or without noisy labels. The code and data for the proposed method are provided for research purposes https://github.com/Anfeather/Eigen-Reptile."

However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks."

Typically, each advertiser launches multiple creatives via online A/B tests to infer effective creatives for the target audience, that are then refined further in an iterative fashion. Due to the manual nature of this process, it is time-consuming to learn, refine, and deploy the modified creatives. Since major ad platforms typically run A/B tests for multiple advertisers in parallel, we explore the possibility of collaboratively learning ad creative refinement via A/B tests of multiple advertisers. In particular, given an input ad creative, we study approaches to refine the given ad text and image by: (i) generating new ad text, (ii) recommending keyphrases for new ad text, and (iii) recommending image tags (objects in image) to select new ad image. Based on A/B tests conducted by multiple advertisers, we form pairwise examples of inferior and superior ad creatives, and use such pairs to train models for the above tasks. For generating new ad text, we demonstrate the efficacy of an encoder-decoder architecture with copy mechanism, which allows some words from the (inferior) input text to be copied to the output while incorporating new words associated with higher click-through-rate. For the keyphrase and image tag recommendation task, we demonstrate the efficacy of a deep relevance matching model, as well as the relative robustness of ranking approaches compared to ad text generation in cold-start scenarios with unseen advertisers."

In this work we show how to make these algorithms batch size-invariant.

In this paper, we propose a higher-order convolutional LSTM model that can efficiently learn these correlations, along with a succinct representations of the history. This is accomplished through a novel tensor train module that performs prediction by combining convolutional features across time. To make this feasible in terms of computation and memory requirements, we propose a novel convolutional tensor-train decomposition of the higher-order model. This decomposition reduces the model complexity by jointly approximating a sequence of convolutional kernels asa low-rank tensor-train factorization. As a result, our model outperforms existing approaches, but uses only a fraction of parameters, including the baseline models.Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications and datasets, including the multi-steps video prediction on the Moving-MNIST-2and KTH action datasets as well as early activity recognition on the Something-Something V2 dataset."

For evasion, we find that changing GPC's curvature to be robust against one attack algorithm boils down to enabling a different norm or attack algorithm to succeed. This is backed up by our formal analysis showing that static security guarantees are opposed to learning. Concerning intellectual property, we show formally that lazy learning does not necessarily leak all information when applied. In practice, often a seemingly secure curvature can be found. For example, we are able to secure GPC against empirical membership inference by proper configuration. In this configuration, however, the GPC's hyper-parameters are leaked, e.g. model reverse engineering succeeds. We conclude that attacks on classification should not be studied in isolation, but in relation to each other."

However, existing datasets to train models for vulnerability identification suffer from multiple limitations such as limited bug context, limited size, and synthetic and unrealistic source code. We propose D2A, a differential analysis based approach to label issues reported by static analysis tools. The D2A dataset is built by analyzing version pairs from multiple open source projects. From each project, we select bug fixing commits and we run static analysis on the versions before and after such commits. If some issues detected in a before-commit version disappear in the corresponding after-commit version, they are very likely to be real bugs that got fixed by the commit. We use D2A to generate a large labeled dataset to train models for vulnerability identification.

An attempt of understanding this puzzle is to discover implicit biases underlying the training process of DNNs, such as the Frequency Principle (F-Principle), i.e., DNNs often fit target functions from low to high frequencies. Inspired by the F-Principle, we propose an effective model of linear F-Principle (LFP) dynamics which accurately predicts the learning results of two-layer ReLU neural networks (NNs) of large widths. This LFP dynamics is rationalized by a linearized mean field residual dynamics of NNs. Importantly, the long-time limit solution of this LFP dynamics is equivalent to the solution of a constrained optimization problem explicitly minimizing an FP-norm, in which higher frequencies of feasible solutions are more heavily penalized. Using this optimization formulation, an a priori estimate of the generalization error bound is provided, revealing that a higher FP-norm of the target function increases the generalization error. Overall, by explicitizing the implicit bias of the F-Principle as an explicit penalty for two-layer NNs, our work makes a step towards a quantitative understanding of the learning and generalization of general DNNs."

This provides a parsimonious GP parameterization that treats qualitative factors the same as numerical variables and views them as effecting the response via similar physical mechanisms. This has strong physical justification, as the effects of a qualitative factor in any physics-based simulation model must always be due to some underlying numerical variables. Even when the underlying variables are many, sufficient dimension reduction arguments imply that their effects can be represented by a low-dimensional LV. This conjecture is supported by the superior predictive performance observed across a variety of examples.

If we use a sequential encoder-decoder model for generating paraphrase, we would like the generated paraphrase to be semantically close to the original sentence. One way to ensure this is by adding constraints for true paraphrase embeddings to be close and unrelated paraphrase candidate sentence embeddings to be far. This is ensured by using a sequential pair-wise discriminator that shares weights with the encoder that is trained with a suitable loss function. Our loss function penalizes paraphrase sentence embedding distances from being too large. This loss is used in combination with a sequential encoder-decoder network.

A Python implementation of BugLab improves by up to 30% upon baseline methods on a test dataset of 2374 real-life bugs and finds 19 previously unknown bugs in open-source software."

        "abstract_text": "Relational representation learning has lately received an increase in interest due to its flexibility in modeling a variety of systems like interacting particles, materials and industrial projects for, e.g., the design of spacecraft. A prominent method for dealing with relational data are knowledge graph embedding algorithms, where entities and relations of a knowledge graph are mapped to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving its semantic structure. Recently, a graph embedding method has been proposed that maps graph elements to the temporal domain of spiking neural networks. However, it relies on encoding graph elements through populations of neurons that only spike once. Here, we present a model that allows us to learn spike train-based embeddings of knowledge graphs, requiring only one neuron per graph element by fully utilizing the temporal domain of spike patterns. This coding scheme can be implemented with arbitrary spiking neuron models as long as gradients with respect to spike times can be calculated, which we demonstrate for the integrate-and-fire neuron model. In general, the presented results show how relational knowledge can be integrated into spike-based systems, opening up the possibility of merging event-based computing and relational data to build powerful and energy efficient artificial intelligence applications and reasoning systems."

The final algorithm has a model size of only 46 thousand parameters, yielding a memory footprint of only 92 KB. Two datasets containing 11 challenging hand gestures performed by 26 different people have been recorded containing a total of 20,210 gesture instances. On the 11 hand gesture dataset, accuracies of 86.6% (26 users) and 92.4% (single user) have been achieved, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art, which achieves 87% (10 users) and 94% (single user), while using a TCN-based network that is 7500x smaller than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the gesture recognition classifier has been implemented on a Parallel Ultra-Low Power Processor, demonstrating that real-time prediction is feasible with only 21 mW of power consumption for the full TCN sequence prediction network, while a system-level power consumption of less than 100 mW is achieved.

To combat the complexity of design choices in multi-branch architectures, prior work has adopted simple strategies, such as a fixed branching factor, the same input being fed to all parallel branches, and an additive combination of the outputs produced by all branches at aggregation points. In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between branches in the network. Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss function defined with respect to the end task. We demonstrate our approach on the problem of multi-class image classification using three different datasets where it yields consistently higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art \"ResNeXt\" multi-branch network given the same learning capacity."

CLAM begins with a fast hierarchical clustering technique and then induces a graph from the cluster tree, based on overlapping clusters as selected using several geometric and topological features. Using these graphs, we implement CHAODA (Clustered Hierarchical Anomaly and Outlier Detection Algorithms), exploring various properties of the graphs and their constituent clusters to find outliers. CHAODA employs a form of transfer learning based on a training set of datasets, and applies this knowledge to a separate test set of datasets of different cardinalities, dimensionalities, and domains. On 24 publicly available datasets, we compare CHAODA (by measure of ROC AUC) to a variety of state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly-detection algorithms. Six of the datasets are used for training.

To avoid data exchange with ground-based processing nodes, a federated learning approach is adopted between a UAV leader and the swarm members to improve the local learning model while avoiding excessive air-to-ground and ground-to-air communications. Moreover, the proposed deployment framework considers the stringent energy constraints of UAVs and the problem of class imbalance, where we show that considering these design parameters significantly improves the performances of the UAV swarm in terms of classification accuracy, energy consumption and availability of UAVs when compared with several baseline algorithms."

However, accessing sufficient labelled training samples and integrating high-quality, routinely collected data from heterogeneous in-home monitoring technologies are main obstacles hindered utilising these technologies in real-world medicine. This work presents a semi-supervised model that can continuously learn from routinely collected in-home observation and measurement data. We show how our model can process highly imbalanced and dynamic data to make robust predictions in analysing the risk of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in dementia. UTIs are common in older adults and constitute one of the main causes of avoidable hospital admissions in people with dementia (PwD). Health-related conditions, such as UTI, have a lower prevalence in individuals, which classifies them as sporadic cases (i.e. rare or scattered, yet important events). This limits the access to sufficient training data, without which the supervised learning models risk becoming overfitted or biased. We introduce a probabilistic semi-supervised learning framework to address these issues. The proposed method produces a risk analysis score for UTIs using routinely collected data by in-home sensing technologies."

In this paper, we leverage data from a large livestreaming platform to examine this belief. We are able to do this as this platform also allows viewers to purchase the recorded version of the livestream. We summarize the value of livestreaming content by estimating how demand responds to price before, on the day of, and after the livestream. We do this by proposing a generalized Orthogonal Random Forest framework. This framework allows us to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional confounders whose relationships with the treatment policy (i.e., price) are complex but partially known. We find significant dynamics in the price elasticity of demand over the temporal distance to the scheduled livestreaming day and after. Specifically, demand gradually becomes less price sensitive over time to the livestreaming day and is inelastic on the livestreaming day. Over the post-livestream period, demand is still sensitive to price, but much less than the pre-livestream period. This indicates that the vlaue of livestreaming persists beyond the live component. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence for the likely mechanisms driving our results. These are quality uncertainty reduction for the patterns pre- and post-livestream and the potential of real-time interaction with the creator on the day of the livestream."

Differentiable quantization with straight-through gradients allows to learn the quantizer's parameters using gradient methods. We show that a suited parametrization of the quantizer is the key to achieve a stable training and a good final performance. Specifically, we propose to parametrize the quantizer with the step size and dynamic range. The bitwidth can then be inferred from them. Other parametrizations, which explicitly use the bitwidth, consistently perform worse. We confirm our findings with experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and we obtain mixed precision DNNs with learned quantization parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

Here we study MAXENT in a Bayesian decision theory set-up, i.e. assuming that there exists a well-defined prior Dirichlet density for unknown probabilities, and that the average Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance can be employed for deciding on the quality and applicability of various estimators. These allow to evaluate the relevance of various MAXENT constraints, check its general applicability, and compare MAXENT with estimators having various degrees of dependence on the prior, viz. the regularized maximum likelihood (ML) and the Bayesian estimators. We show that MAXENT applies in sparse data regimes, but needs specific types of prior information.

To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block may be any neural network - for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition, routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch networks scale linearly with the number of tasks. On CIFAR-100 (20 tasks) we obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% reduction in training time."

We are mainly concerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL perform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what conditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task during simultaneous learning? In particular, we investigate two types of task-group relatedness: the observed discrepancy-dependence measure (ODDM) and the empirical discrepancy-dependence measure (EDDM), both of which detect the dependence between two groups of multiple related tasks (MRTs). We then introduce the Cartesian product-based uniform entropy number (CPUEN) to measure the complexities of vector-valued function classes. By applying the specific deviation and the symmetrization inequalities to the vector-valued framework, we obtain the generalization bound for RMTL, which is the upper bound of the joint probability of the event that there is at least one task with a large empirical discrepancy between the expected and empirical risks. Finally, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in the simultaneous learning process, and we discuss how task relatedness affects the generalization performance of RMTL. Our theoretical findings answer the aforementioned two questions."

In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to manage the credit limit intelligently. Firstly, a conditional independence testing is conducted to acquire the data for building models. Based on these testing data, a response model is then built to measure the heterogeneous treatment effect of increasing credit limits (i.e. treatments) for different customers, who are depicted by several control variables (i.e. features). In order to incorporate the diminishing marginal effect, a carefully selected log transformation is introduced to the treatment variable. Moreover, the model's capability can be further enhanced by applying a non-linear transformation on features via GBDT encoding. Finally, a well-designed metric is proposed to properly measure the performances of compared methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Our experiments show that none of the methods we tested is unequivocally superior to all others, and none produces a particularly reliable ranking of errors across multiple datasets. While we believe these results show that existing UQ methods are not sufficient for all common use-cases and demonstrate the benefits of further research, we conclude with a practical recommendation as to which existing techniques seem to perform well relative to others."

A Spatial Point Transformer is first introduced to map the input local surface into a carefully designed cylindrical space, enabling end-to-end optimization with SO(2) equivariant representation. A Neural Feature Extractor which leverages the powerful point-based and 3D cylindrical convolutional neural layers is then utilized to derive a compact and representative descriptor for matching.

Based on this, our system first learns a discriminative subspace of vowel sequences, based on weighted symmetric non-negative matrix factorization (WS-NMF), by taking the self-similarity of a standard acoustic feature as an input. Then, we make use of canonical time warping (CTW), derived from a recent computer vision technique, to find an optimal spatiotemporal transformation between the text and the acoustic sequences.

This adaptive minimizer is changed further by stochastic mini-batch training, even though in the non-adaptive case GD and stochastic GD result in essentially the same minimizer.

Our causal perspective clearly distinguishes between gaming and improvement and reveals an important obstacle to incentive design. We prove any procedure for designing classifiers that incentivize improvement must inevitably solve a non-trivial causal inference problem.

Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network for sequence modeling. Most of all, our method is very robust under noisy and inaccurate training labels and thus can handle human errors during the labeling process."

        "abstract_text": "State-of-the-art deep learning systems often require large amounts of data and computation. For this reason, leveraging known or unknown structure of the data is paramount. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successful examples of this principle, their defining characteristic being the shift-equivariance. By sliding a filter over the input, when the input shifts, the response shifts by the same amount, exploiting the structure of natural images where semantic content is independent of absolute pixel positions. This property is essential to the success of CNNs in audio, image and video recognition tasks. In this thesis, we extend equivariance to other kinds of transformations, such as rotation and scaling. We propose equivariant models for different transformations defined by groups of symmetries. The main contributions are (i) polar transformer networks, achieving equivariance to the group of similarities on the plane, (ii) equivariant multi-view networks, achieving equivariance to the group of symmetries of the icosahedron, (iii) spherical CNNs, achieving equivariance to the continuous 3D rotation group, (iv) cross-domain image embeddings, achieving equivariance to 3D rotations for 2D inputs, and (v) spin-weighted spherical CNNs, generalizing the spherical CNNs and achieving equivariance to 3D rotations for spherical vector fields. Applications include image classification, 3D shape classification and retrieval, panoramic image classification and segmentation, shape alignment and pose estimation. What these models have in common is that they leverage symmetries in the data to reduce sample and model complexity and improve generalization performance."

A cerebrospinal fluid sample (CSF) from a suspected sCJD patient is subjected to a process which initiates the aggregation of a protein present only in cases of sCJD. This aggregation is indirectly observed in real-time at regular intervals, so that a longitudinal set of data is constructed that is then analysed for evidence of this aggregation. The best existing test is based solely on the final value of this set of data, which is compared against a threshold to conclude whether or not aggregation, and thus sCJD, is present. This test criterion was decided upon by analysing data from a total of 108 sCJD and non-sCJD samples, but this was done subjectively and there is no supporting mathematical analysis declaring this criterion to be exploiting the available data optimally. This paper addresses this deficiency, seeking to validate or improve the test primarily via support vector machine (SVM) classification. Besides this, we address a number of additional issues such as i) early stopping of the measurement process, ii) the possibility of detecting the particular type of sCJD and iii) the incorporation of additional patient data such as age, sex, disease duration and timing of CSF sampling into the construction of the test."

In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive Gradient Method with Resilience and Momentum (AdaRem), motivated by the observation that the oscillations of network parameters slow the training, and give a theoretical proof of convergence. For each parameter, AdaRem adjusts the parameter-wise learning rate according to whether the direction of one parameter changes in the past is aligned with the direction of the current gradient, and thus encourages long-term consistent parameter updating with much fewer oscillations. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of AdaRem when training various models on a large-scale image recognition dataset, e.g., ImageNet, which also demonstrate that our method outperforms previous adaptive learning rate-based algorithms in terms of the training speed and the test error, respectively."

To explicitly address these issues, in this paper, a Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS (BS-NAS) framework is proposed, in which `broadening' refers to broadening the search space with a spring block enabling search for numbers of channels during training of the supernet; while `shrinking' refers to a novel shrinking strategy gradually turning off those underperforming operations. The above innovations broaden the search space for wider representation and then shrink it by gradually removing underperforming operations, followed by an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently search for the optimal architecture.

To train the GATCluster in a completely unsupervised manner, we design four self-learning tasks with the constraints of transformation invariance, separability maximization, entropy analysis, and attention mapping. Specifically, the transformation invariance and separability maximization tasks learn the relationships between sample pairs. The entropy analysis task aims to avoid trivial solutions. To capture the object-oriented semantics, we design a self-supervised attention mechanism that includes a parameterized attention module and a soft-attention loss. All the guiding signals for clustering are self-generated during the training process. Moreover, we develop a two-step learning algorithm that is memory-efficient for clustering large-size images.

However, federated learning systems are vulnerable to interference from malicious learning agents who may desire to prevent training or induce targeted misclassification in the resulting global model. A class of Byzantine-tolerant aggregation algorithms has emerged, offering varying degrees of robustness against these attacks, often with the caveat that the number of attackers is bounded by some quantity known prior to training. This paper presents Simeon: a novel approach to aggregation that applies a reputation-based iterative filtering technique to achieve robustness even in the presence of attackers who can exhibit arbitrary behaviour. We compare Simeon to state-of-the-art aggregation techniques and find that Simeon achieves comparable or superior robustness to a variety of attacks.

Despite the successful applications of GNNs in many domains, the optimization of GNNs is less well studied, and the performance on node classification heavily suffers from the long-tailed node degree distribution. This paper focuses on improving the performance of GNNs via normalization. In detail, by studying the long-tailed distribution of node degrees in the graph, we propose a novel normalization method for GNNs, which is termed ResNorm (\\textbf{Res}haping the long-tailed distribution into a normal-like distribution via \\textbf{norm}alization). The $scale$ operation of ResNorm reshapes the node-wise standard deviation (NStd) distribution so as to improve the accuracy of tail nodes (\\textit{i}.\\textit{e}., low-degree nodes). We provide a theoretical interpretation and empirical evidence for understanding the mechanism of the above $scale$. In addition to the long-tailed distribution issue, over-smoothing is also a fundamental issue plaguing the community. To this end, we analyze the behavior of the standard shift and prove that the standard shift serves as a preconditioner on the weight matrix, increasing the risk of over-smoothing. With the over-smoothing issue in mind, we design a $shift$ operation for ResNorm that simulates the degree-specific parameter strategy in a low-cost manner.

To bring NNs to edge devices, several optimizations such as model compression through pruning, quantization, and off-the-shelf architectures with efficient design have been extensively adopted. These algorithms when deployed to real world sensitive applications, requires to resist inference attacks to protect privacy of users training data. However, resistance against inference attacks is not accounted for designing NN models for IoT. In this work, we analyse the three-dimensional privacy-accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in NNs for IoT devices and propose Gecko training methodology where we explicitly add resistance to private inferences as a design objective. We optimize the inference-time memory, computation, and power constraints of embedded devices as a criterion for designing NN architecture while also preserving privacy. We choose quantization as design choice for highly efficient and private models. This choice is driven by the observation that compressed models leak more information compared to baseline models while off-the-shelf efficient architectures indicate poor efficiency and privacy tradeoff. We show that models trained using Gecko methodology are comparable to prior defences against black-box membership attacks in terms of accuracy and privacy while providing efficiency."

Unlike most RL settings, the reward in AIL is differentiable but model-free RL algorithms do not make use of this property to train a policy. In contrast, we leverage the differentiability property of the AIL reward function and formulate a class of Actor Residual Critic (ARC) RL algorithms that draw a parallel to the standard Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in RL literature and uses a residual critic, C function (instead of the standard Q function) to approximate only the discounted future return (excluding the immediate reward). ARC algorithms have similar convergence properties as the standard AC algorithms with the additional advantage that the gradient through the immediate reward is exact. For the discrete (tabular) case with finite states, actions, and known dynamics, we prove that policy iteration with $C$ function converges to an optimal policy. In the continuous case with function approximation and unknown dynamics, we experimentally show that ARC aided AIL outperforms standard AIL in simulated continuous-control and real robotic manipulation tasks. ARC algorithms are simple to implement and can be incorporated into any existing AIL implementation with an AC algorithm."

Applying QSAR modeling to DEL data can facilitate the selection of compounds for off-DNA synthesis and evaluation. Such a combined approach has been shown recently by training binary classifiers to learn DEL enrichments of aggregated \"disynthons\" to accommodate the sparse and noisy nature of DEL data. However, a binary classifier cannot distinguish between different levels of enrichment, and information is potentially lost during disynthon aggregation. Here, we demonstrate a regression approach to learning DEL enrichments of individual molecules using a custom negative log-likelihood loss function that effectively denoises DEL data and introduces opportunities for visualization of learned structure-activity relationships (SAR). Our approach explicitly models the Poisson statistics of the sequencing process used in the DEL experimental workflow under a frequentist view. We illustrate this approach on a dataset of 108k compounds screened against CAIX, and a dataset of 5.7M compounds screened against sEH and SIRT2. Due to the treatment of uncertainty in the data through the negative log-likelihood loss function, the models can ignore low-confidence outliers. While our approach does not demonstrate a benefit for extrapolation to novel structures, we expect our denoising and visualization pipeline to be useful in identifying SAR trends and enriched pharmacophores in DEL data."

The proposed HI-VAE includes likelihood models for real-valued, positive real valued, interval, categorical, ordinal and count data, and allows accurate estimation (and potentially imputation) of missing data.

We apply our algorithm, Self-Tuning Actor-Critic (STAC), to self-tune all the differentiable hyperparameters of an actor-critic loss function, to discover auxiliary tasks, and to improve off-policy learning using a novel leaky V-trace operator. STAC is simple to use, sample efficient and does not require a significant increase in compute. Ablative studies show that the overall performance of STAC improved as we adapt more hyperparameters. When applied to the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al. 2012), STAC improved the median human normalized score in 200M steps from 243% to 364%. When applied to the DM Control suite (Tassa et al., 2018), STAC improved the mean score in 30M steps from 217 to 389 when learning with features, from 108 to 202 when learning from pixels, and from 195 to 295 in the Real-World Reinforcement Learning Challenge (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2020)."

We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data - the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task."

However, the main focus of such analysis has been on achieving high prediction accuracy while little effort has been spent on the important task of understanding the association between the two data modalities. Performance on the time series hence receives little explanation though human-understandable textual information is available. In this work, we address the problem of given a numerical time series, and a general corpus of textual stories collected in the same period of the time series, the task is to timely discover a succinct set of textual stories associated with that time series. Towards this goal, we propose a novel multi-modal neural model called MSIN that jointly learns both numerical time series and categorical text articles in order to unearth the association between them. Through multiple steps of data interrelation between the two data modalities, MSIN learns to focus on a small subset of text articles that best align with the performance in the time series. This succinct set is timely discovered and presented as recommended documents, acting as automated information filtering, for the given time series.

Perhaps surprisingly, our positive results show that for a broad class of sequences, there is an algorithm that predicts well on average, and bases its predictions only on the most recent few observation together with a set of simple summary statistics of the past observations. Specifically, we show that for any distribution over observations, if the mutual information between past observations and future observations is upper bounded by $I$, then a simple Markov model over the most recent $I/\\epsilon$ observations obtains expected KL error $\\epsilon$---and hence $\\ell_1$ error $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$---with respect to the optimal predictor that has access to the entire past and knows the data generating distribution. For a Hidden Markov Model with $n$ hidden states, $I$ is bounded by $\\log n$, a quantity that does not depend on the mixing time, and we show that the trivial prediction algorithm based on the empirical frequencies of length $O(\\log n/\\epsilon)$ windows of observations achieves this error, provided the length of the sequence is $d^{\\Omega(\\log n/\\epsilon)}$, where $d$ is the size of the observation alphabet. We also establish that this result cannot be improved upon, even for the class of HMMs, in the following two senses: First, for HMMs with $n$ hidden states, a window length of $\\log n/\\epsilon$ is information-theoretically necessary to achieve expected $\\ell_1$ error $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$."

They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives."

Recently, we have seen an acceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE) using machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective: CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood by practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is different, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the use of statistical models for CDM. We draw on prior research to highlight three implications. (1) We should consider carefully the objective function of the causal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate treatment assignment rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding does not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot is that for supporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded data as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical modeling may not be necessary to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling might do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least one broad common CDM practice that seems wrong at first blush: the widespread use of non-causal models for targeting interventions."

GLN makes location predictions based on robust location representations extracted from images through message-passing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel zero-shot indoor localization setting and tackle it by extending the proposed GLN to a dedicated zero-shot version, which exploits a novel mechanism Map2Vec to train location-aware embeddings and make predictions on novel unseen locations. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the standard setting, and achieves promising accuracy even in the zero-shot setting where data for half of the locations are not available.

        "abstract_text": "Learning algorithms produce software models for realising critical classification tasks. Decision trees models are simpler than other models such as neural network and they are used in various critical domains such as the medical and the aeronautics. Low or unknown learning ability algorithms does not permit us to trust the produced software models, which lead to costly test activities for validating the models and to the waste of learning time in case the models are likely to be faulty due to the learning inability. Methods for evaluating the decision trees learning ability, as well as that for the other models, are needed especially since the testing of the learned models is still a hot topic. We propose a novel oracle-centered approach to evaluate (the learning ability of) learning algorithms for decision trees. It consists of generating data from reference trees playing the role of oracles, producing learned trees with existing learning algorithms, and determining the degree of correctness (DOE) of the learned trees by comparing them with the oracles. The average DOE is used to estimate the quality of the learning algorithm. the We assess five decision tree learning algorithms based on the proposed approach."

In this work, we apply Projective Simulation to model each individual as an artificial learning agent that interacts with its neighbors and surroundings in order to make decisions and learn from them. Within a reinforcement learning framework, we discuss one-dimensional learning scenarios where agents need to get to food resources to be rewarded. We observe how different types of collective motion emerge depending on the distance the agents need to travel to reach the resources. For instance, strongly aligned swarms emerge when the food source is placed far away from the region where agents are situated initially. In addition, we study the properties of the individual trajectories that occur within the different types of emergent collective dynamics. Agents trained to find distant resources exhibit individual trajectories with L\\'evy-like characteristics as a consequence of the collective motion, whereas agents trained to reach nearby resources present Brownian-like trajectories."

The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism. Different algorithms and training paradigms can lead to different causal influence diagrams, so our method can be used to identify algorithms with problematic incentives and help in designing algorithms with better incentives."

In this paper, we categorize federated matrix factorization into three types based on the partition of feature space and analyze privacy threats against each type of federated matrix factorization model.

However, due to the high computational complexity of its eigen decomposition solution, it hard to apply PCA to the large-scale data with high dimensionality.

In recent research, the L1-norm maximization based PCA method was proposed for efficient computation and being robust to outliers. However, this work used a greedy strategy to solve the eigen vectors. Moreover, the L1-norm maximization based objective may not be the correct robust PCA formulation, because it loses the theoretical connection to the minimization of data reconstruction error, which is one of the most important intuitions and goals of PCA. In this paper, we propose to maximize the L21-norm based robust PCA objective, which is theoretically connected to the minimization of reconstruction error.

We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets.

One of the research topics that investigates this scenario is referred to as domain adaptation. Deep neural networks brought dramatic advances in pattern recognition and that is why there have been many attempts to provide good domain adaptation algorithms for these models. Here we take a different avenue and approach the problem from an incremental point of view, where the model is adapted to the new domain iteratively. We make use of an existing unsupervised domain-adaptation algorithm to identify the target samples on which there is greater confidence about their true label. The output of the model is analyzed in different ways to determine the candidate samples. The selected set is then added to the source training set by considering the labels provided by the network as ground truth, and the process is repeated until all target samples are labelled.

To accomplish this, we introduce the Asymmetric Buckling Columns (ABC) dataset, a dataset comprised of three sub-datasets of asymmetric and heterogeneous column geometries where the goal is to classify the direction of symmetry breaking (left or right) under compression after the onset of instability. Because of complex local geometry, the \"image-like\" data representations required for implementing standard convolutional neural network based metamodels are not ideal, thus motivating the use of GNNs.

Due to the imminent need to alleviate the communication burden, the investigation of communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms - particularly for empirical risk minimization - has flourished in recent years. A large fraction of these algorithms have been developed for the master/slave setting, relying on a central parameter server that can communicate with all agents. This paper focuses on distributed optimization over networks, or decentralized optimization, where each agent is only allowed to aggregate information from its neighbors. By properly adjusting the global gradient estimate via local averaging in conjunction with proper correction, we develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method Network-DANE, which generalizes DANE to the decentralized scenarios. Our key ideas can be applied in a systematic manner to obtain decentralized versions of other master/slave distributed algorithms. A notable development is Network-SVRG/SARAH, which employs variance reduction to further accelerate local computation. We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and Network-SVRG for strongly convex losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic losses, which shed light on the impacts of data homogeneity, network connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence. We further extend Network-DANE to composite optimization by allowing a nonsmooth penalty term. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the appealing performance of our algorithms over competitive baselines, in terms of both communication and computation efficiency.

        "abstract_text": "The problem of domain adaptation conventionally considers the setting where a source domain has plenty of labeled data, and a target domain (with a different data distribution) has plenty of unlabeled data but none or very limited labeled data. In this paper, we address the setting where the target domain has only limited labeled data from a distribution that is expected to change frequently. We first propose a fast and light-weight method for adapting a Gaussian mixture density network (MDN) using only a small set of target domain samples. This method is well-suited for the setting where the distribution of target data changes rapidly (e.g., a wireless channel), making it challenging to collect a large number of samples and retrain. We then apply the proposed MDN adaptation method to the problem of end-of-end learning of a wireless communication autoencoder. A communication autoencoder models the encoder, decoder, and the channel using neural networks, and learns them jointly to minimize the overall decoding error rate. However, the error rate of an autoencoder trained on a particular (source) channel distribution can degrade as the channel distribution changes frequently, not allowing enough time for data collection and retraining of the autoencoder to the target channel distribution. We propose a method for adapting the autoencoder without modifying the encoder and decoder neural networks, and adapting only the MDN model of the channel. The method utilizes feature transformations at the decoder to compensate for changes in the channel distribution, and effectively present to the decoder samples close to the source distribution."

This problem is of importance for many applications, e.g., for signal and image processing where signals appear and disappear at unknown points in time or space. In contrast to the conventional optimality criterion in quickest change detection that requires minimization of the expected delay to detection for a given average run length to a false alarm, we focus on a reliable maximin change detection criterion of maximizing the minimal probability of detection in a given time (or space) window for a given local maximal probability of false alarm in the prescribed window. We show that the optimal detection procedure is a modified CUSUM procedure. We then compare operating characteristics of this optimal procedure with popular in engineering the Finite Moving Average (FMA) detection algorithm and the ordinary CUSUM procedure using Monte Carlo simulations, which show that typically the later algorithms have almost the same performance as the optimal one. At the same time, the FMA procedure has a substantial advantage -- independence to the intensity of the signal, which is usually unknown. Finally, the FMA algorithm is applied to detecting faint streaks of satellites in optical images."

Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity w.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes information at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same resolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual information in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential relations between query representation and clues of different attention granularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to query, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla Transformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention without degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a state-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made publicly available."

A dynamic gesture signed by the user is characterized by a generic set of features extracted across time and frequency domains. The system was analyzed from an end-user perspective and was modelled to operate in three modes. The modes of operation determine the subsets of data to be used for training and testing the system. From an initial set of seven classifiers, three were chosen to evaluate each dataset across all modes rendering the system towards mode-neutrality and dataset-independence. The proposed system is able to classify gestures performed at varying speeds with minimum preprocessing, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, this system was found to run on a low-cost embedded platform - Raspberry Pi Zero (USD 5), making it economically viable."

Our evaluation demonstrates that DiffSketch can provide strong differential privacy guarantees (e.g., $\\varepsilon$= 1) and reduce communication by 20-50x with only marginal decreases in accuracy. Compared to baselines that treat privacy and communication separately, DiffSketch improves absolute test accuracy by 5%-50% while offering the same privacy guarantees and communication compression."

In our experiment, we compare the proposed bit representation waveform, which is directly given to a neural network, to other representations of audio waveforms such as a raw audio waveform and a power spectrum with two classification tasks: one is an acoustic event classification task and the other is a sound/music classification task.

Thus, when performance benchmarking new microarchitectures, performance teams may assume that the design is correct when the performance of the new microarchitecture exceeds that of the previous generation, despite significant performance regressions existing in the design. In this work, we present a two-stage, machine learning-based methodology that is able to detect the existence of performance bugs in microprocessors. Our results show that our best technique detects 91.5% of microprocessor core performance bugs whose average IPC impact across the studied applications is greater than 1% versus a bug-free design with zero false positives. When evaluated on memory system bugs, our technique achieves 100% detection with zero false positives. Moreover, the detection is automatic, requiring very little performance engineer time."

        "abstract_text": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse. Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while maintaining or even improving the task accuracy."

Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics (e.g., dengue, malaria, hepatitis, influenza, and most recent, Covid-19) exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyze a wide variety of epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it EWNet. MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the forecasting scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet network framework.

        "abstract_text": "We consider the problem of global optimization of an unknown non-convex smooth function with zeroth-order feedback. In this setup, an algorithm is allowed to adaptively query the underlying function at different locations and receives noisy evaluations of function values at the queried points (i.e. the algorithm has access to zeroth-order information). Optimization performance is evaluated by the expected difference of function values at the estimated optimum and the true optimum. In contrast to the classical optimization setup, first-order information like gradients are not directly accessible to the optimization algorithm. We show that the classical minimax framework of analysis, which roughly characterizes the worst-case query complexity of an optimization algorithm in this setting, leads to excessively pessimistic results. We propose a local minimax framework to study the fundamental difficulty of optimizing smooth functions with adaptive function evaluations, which provides a refined picture of the intrinsic difficulty of zeroth-order optimization. We show that for functions with fast level set growth around the global minimum, carefully designed optimization algorithms can identify a near global minimizer with many fewer queries. For the special case of strongly convex and smooth functions, our implied convergence rates match the ones developed for zeroth-order convex optimization problems. At the other end of the spectrum, for worst-case smooth functions no algorithm can converge faster than the minimax rate of estimating the entire unknown function in the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. We provide an intuitive and efficient algorithm that attains the derived upper error bounds."

To automatically extract OTEs, supervised learning algorithms are usually employed which are trained on manually annotated corpora. The creation of these corpora is labor-intensive and sufficiently large datasets are therefore usually only available for a very narrow selection of languages and domains. In this work, we address the lack of available annotated data for specific languages by proposing a zero-shot cross-lingual approach for the extraction of opinion target expressions. We leverage multilingual word embeddings that share a common vector space across various languages and incorporate these into a convolutional neural network architecture for OTE extraction. Our experiments with 5 languages give promising results: We can successfully train a model on annotated data of a source language and perform accurate prediction on a target language without ever using any annotated samples in that target language. Depending on the source and target language pairs, we reach performances in a zero-shot regime of up to 77% of a model trained on target language data. Furthermore, we can increase this performance up to 87% of a baseline model trained on target language data by performing cross-lingual learning from multiple source languages."

Recent solutions for MSL and MTL are mostly based on the multi-gate mixture-of-experts (MMoE) architecture. MMoE structure is typically static and its design requires domain-specific knowledge, making it less effective in handling both MSL and MTL. In this paper, we propose a novel Automatic Expert Selection framework for Multi-scenario and Multi-task search, named AESM^{2}. AESM^{2} integrates both MSL and MTL into a unified framework with an automatic structure learning. Specifically, AESM^{2} stacks multi-task layers over multi-scenario layers. This hierarchical design enables us to flexibly establish intrinsic connections between different scenarios, and at the same time also supports high-level feature extraction for different tasks. At each multi-scenario/multi-task layer, a novel expert selection algorithm is proposed to automatically identify scenario-/task-specific and shared experts for each input. Experiments over two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AESM^{2} over a battery of strong baselines.

The latter correspond to a rotation of the marginals with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$.

To further improve the performance of LsrKD, we develop a self-distillation method named Memory-replay Knowledge Distillation (MrKD) that provides a knowledgeable teacher to replace the uniform distribution one in LsrKD. The MrKD method penalizes the KD loss between the current model's output distributions and its copies' on the training trajectory. By preventing the model learning so far from its historical output distribution space, MrKD can stabilize the learning and find a more robust minimum. Our experiments show that LsrKD can improve LSR performance consistently at no cost, especially on several deep neural networks where LSR is ineffectual. Also, MrKD can significantly improve single model training. The experiment results confirm that the TC can help LsrKD and MrKD to boost training, especially on the networks they are failed.

Inspired by this, we look at the relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation. From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings support the observation that the selection of feature representations that attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning."

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMA regularization is able to enhance the generalization ability of various modern models and achieves considerable performance improvements on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

In this work, we develop a hierarchy of deep neural network time-steppers to approximate the flow map of the dynamical system over a disparate range of time-scales. The resulting model is purely data-driven and leverages features of the multiscale dynamics, enabling numerical integration and forecasting that is both accurate and highly efficient. Moreover, similar ideas can be used to couple neural network-based models with classical numerical time-steppers. Our multiscale hierarchical time-stepping scheme provides important advantages over current time-stepping algorithms, including (i) circumventing numerical stiffness due to disparate time-scales, (ii) improved accuracy in comparison with leading neural-network architectures, (iii) efficiency in long-time simulation/forecasting due to explicit training of slow time-scale dynamics, and (iv) a flexible framework that is parallelizable and may be integrated with standard numerical time-stepping algorithms. The method is demonstrated on a wide range of nonlinear dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and fluid flow pass a cylinder; audio and video signals are also explored.

Alternatively, researchers can collect human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that model to train \"human-aware\" agents (\"behavioral cloning play\", or BCP). While such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners. Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call Fictitious Co-Play (FCP). Our experiments focus on a two-player collaborative cooking simulator that has recently been proposed as a challenge problem for coordination with humans. We find that FCP agents score significantly higher than SP, PP, and BCP when paired with novel agent and human partners.

This necessitates sampling rates exceeding the Nyquist rate and the use of a large number of antenna elements to ensure sufficient image quality. Recently we proposed methods to reduce the sampling rate and the array size relying on image recovery using iterative algorithms, based on compressed sensing (CS) and the finite rate of innovation (FRI) frameworks. Iterative algorithms typically require a large number of iterations, making them difficult to use in real-time. Here, we propose a reconstruction method from sub-Nyquist samples in the time and spatial domain, that is based on unfolding the ISTA algorithm, resulting in an efficient and interpretable deep network. The inputs to our network are the subsampled beamformed signals after summation and delay in the frequency domain, requiring only a subset of the US signal to be stored for recovery. Our method allows reducing the number of array elements, sampling rate, and computational time while ensuring high quality imaging performance. Using \\emph{in vivo} data we demonstrate that the proposed method yields high-quality images while reducing the data volume traditionally used up to 36 times. In terms of image resolution and contrast, our technique outperforms previously suggested methods as well as DAS and minimum-variance (MV) beamforming, paving the way to real-time applicable recovery methods."

        "abstract_text": "We study a repeated persuasion setting between a sender and a receiver, where at each time $t$, the sender observes a payoff-relevant state drawn independently and identically from an unknown prior distribution, and shares state information with the receiver, who then myopically chooses an action. As in the standard setting, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver into choosing actions that are aligned with the sender's preference by selectively sharing information about the state. However, in contrast to the standard models, the sender does not know the prior, and has to persuade while gradually learning the prior on the fly. We study the sender's learning problem of making persuasive action recommendations to achieve low regret against the optimal persuasion mechanism with the knowledge of the prior distribution. Our main positive result is an algorithm that, with high probability, is persuasive across all rounds and achieves $O(\\sqrt{T\\log T})$ regret, where $T$ is the horizon length. The core philosophy behind the design of our algorithm is to leverage robustness against the sender's ignorance of the prior. Intuitively, at each time our algorithm maintains a set of candidate priors, and chooses a persuasion scheme that is simultaneously persuasive for all of them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we further prove that no algorithm can achieve regret better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, even if the persuasiveness requirements were significantly relaxed. Therefore, our algorithm achieves optimal regret for the sender's learning problem up to terms logarithmic in $T$."

        "abstract_text": "We introduce causal Markov Decision Processes (C-MDPs), a new formalism for sequential decision making which combines the standard MDP formulation with causal structures over state transition and reward functions. Many contemporary and emerging application areas such as digital healthcare and digital marketing can benefit from modeling with C-MDPs due to the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship between interventions and states/rewards. We propose the causal upper confidence bound value iteration (C-UCBVI) algorithm that exploits the causal structure in C-MDPs and improves the performance of standard reinforcement learning algorithms that do not take causal knowledge into account. We prove that C-UCBVI satisfies an $\\tilde{O}(HS\\sqrt{ZT})$ regret bound, where $T$ is the the total time steps, $H$ is the episodic horizon, and $S$ is the cardinality of the state space. Notably, our regret bound does not scale with the size of actions/interventions ($A$), but only scales with a causal graph dependent quantity $Z$ which can be exponentially smaller than $A$. By extending C-UCBVI to the factored MDP setting, we propose the causal factored UCBVI (CF-UCBVI) algorithm, which further reduces the regret exponentially in terms of $S$. Furthermore, we show that RL algorithms for linear MDP problems can also be incorporated in C-MDPs. We empirically show the benefit of our causal approaches in various settings to validate our algorithms and theoretical results."

For this reason, the automated detection and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems, thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of 241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a MOTA of 96.3%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in the UAV domain."

In this work, we introduce \\emph{reward tweaking}. Reward tweaking learns a surrogate reward function $\\tilde r$ for the discounted setting that induces optimal behavior on the original finite-horizon total reward task. Theoretically, we show that there exists a surrogate reward that leads to optimality in the original task and discuss the robustness of our approach.

Hence, selection of the most important kernels and pruning the redundant and less important ones is necessary to reduce computational complexity and accelerate inference of Rocket. Selection of these kernels is a combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, the kernels selection process is modeled as an optimization problem and a population-based approach is proposed for selecting the most important kernels. This approach is evaluated on the standard time series datasets and the results show that on average it can achieve a similar performance to the original models by pruning more than 60% of kernels. In some cases, it can achieve a similar performance using only 1% of the kernels."

Recently, research in scenario planning benefits from utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as generative models for operational scenario planning. In these scenarios, operators examine temporal as well as spatial influences of different energy sources on the grid. The analysis of how renewable energy resources affect the grid enables the operators to evaluate the stability and to identify potential weak points such as a limiting transformer. However, due to their novelty, there are limited studies on how well GANs model the underlying power distribution. This analysis is essential because, e.g., especially extreme situations with low or high power generation are required to evaluate grid stability. We conduct a comparative study of the Wasserstein distance, binary-cross-entropy loss, and a Gaussian copula as the baseline applied on two wind and two solar datasets with limited data compared to previous studies. Both GANs achieve good results considering the limited amount of data, but the Wasserstein GAN is superior in modeling temporal and spatial relations, and the power distribution. Besides evaluating the generated power distribution over all farms, it is essential to assess terrain specific distributions for wind scenarios. These terrain specific power distributions affect the grid by their differences in their generating power magnitude."

To correct for sense drift, fine-tuning, regularization, projection, and pivoting have been proposed recently. Among these, regularization informed by a word's corpus frequency performed well, but we improve upon it using a new regularizer based on the stability of its cooccurrence with other words. However, a thorough comparison across ten topics, spanning three tasks, with standardized settings of hyper-parameters, reveals that even the best embedding adaptation strategies provide small gains beyond well-tuned baselines, which many earlier comparisons ignored. In a bold departure from adapting pretrained embeddings, we propose using $\\mathcal D_T$ to probe, attend to, and borrow fragments from any large, topic-rich source corpus (such as Wikipedia), which need not be the corpus used to pretrain embeddings. This step is made scalable and practical by suitable indexing.

The length of this chain scales linearly with the number of time-steps as the same network is run at each time-step. This creates many problems, such as vanishing gradients, that have been well studied. In contrast, a NNEM's architecture recurrent activity doesn't involve a long chain of activity (though some architectures such as the NTM do utilize a traditional recurrent architecture as a controller). Rather, the externally stored embedding vectors are used at each time-step, but no messages are passed from previous time-steps. This means that vanishing gradients aren't a problem, as all of the necessary gradient paths are short. However, these paths are extremely numerous (one per embedding vector in memory) and reused for a very long time (until it leaves the memory). Thus, the forward-pass information of each memory must be stored for the entire duration of the memory. This is problematic as this additional storage far surpasses that of the actual memories, to the extent that large memories on infeasible to back-propagate through in high dimensional settings. One way to get around the need to hold onto forward-pass information is to recalculate the forward-pass whenever gradient information is available. However, if the observations are too large to store in the domain of interest, direct reinstatement of a forward pass cannot occur. Instead, we rely on a learned autoencoder to reinstate the observation, and then use the embedding network to recalculate the forward-pass."

While empowerment has been shown to solve a broad range of reinforcement learning problems, its calculation in arbitrary dynamics is a challenging problem because it relies on the estimation of mutual information. Existing approaches, which rely on sampling, are limited to low dimensional spaces, because high-confidence distribution-free lower bounds for mutual information require exponential number of samples. In this work, we develop a novel approach for the estimation of empowerment in unknown dynamics from visual observation only, without the need to sample for MIAS. The core idea is to represent the relation between action sequences and future states using a stochastic dynamic model in latent space with a specific form. This allows us to efficiently compute empowerment with the \"Water-Filling\" algorithm from information theory. We construct this embedding with deep neural networks trained on a sophisticated objective function.

        "abstract_text": "In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a given observable evolves independently of its environment. In social networks, users' behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose a new model, the Interactive Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that interactions play an important role in those corpora. In inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interactive models of up to 150\\% in the probability of an outcome. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn."

        "abstract_text": "Learning in strategy games (e.g. StarCraft, poker) requires the discovery of diverse policies. This is often achieved by iteratively training new policies against existing ones, growing a policy population that is robust to exploit. This iterative approach suffers from two issues in real-world games: a) under finite budget, approximate best-response operators at each iteration needs truncating, resulting in under-trained good-responses populating the population; b) repeated learning of basic skills at each iteration is wasteful and becomes intractable in the presence of increasingly strong opponents. In this work, we propose Neural Population Learning (NeuPL) as a solution to both issues. NeuPL offers convergence guarantees to a population of best-responses under mild assumptions. By representing a population of policies within a single conditional model, NeuPL enables transfer learning across policies. Empirically, we show the generality, improved performance and efficiency of NeuPL across several test domains. Most interestingly, we show that novel strategies become more accessible, not less, as the neural population expands."

Inspired by the incremental construction strategy for building a random multilayer perceptron, we propose a novel Error-feedback Stochastic Modeling (ESM) strategy to construct a random Convolutional Neural Network (ESM-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network architecture adaptively. The ESM strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added to steadily compensate the prediction error during the construction process, and then a filter selection strategy is introduced to enable ESM-CNN to extract the different size of temporal features, providing helpful information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of ESM-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks respectively. Comprehensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed ESM-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits stronger predictive power and less computing overhead in comparison to trained state-of-art deep neural network models."

Inspired by the success of ensemble methods and the flexibility of trees, we propose to learn a similarity kernel called rpf-kernel through random projection forests (rpForests). Our theoretical analysis reveals a highly desirable property of rpf-kernel: far-away (dissimilar) points have a low similarity value while nearby (similar) points would have a high similarity}, and the similarities have a native interpretation as the probability of points remaining in the same leaf nodes during the growth of rpForests. The learned rpf-kernel leads to an effective clustering algorithm--rpfCluster. On a wide variety of real and benchmark datasets, rpfCluster compares favorably to K-means clustering, spectral clustering and a state-of-the-art clustering ensemble algorithm--Cluster Forests. Our approach is simple to implement and readily adapt to the geometry of the underlying data. Given its desirable theoretical property and competitive empirical performance when applied to clustering, we expect rpf-kernel to be applicable to many problems of an unsupervised nature or as a regularizer in some supervised or weakly supervised settings."

Our focus is on sample complexity bounds that are as tight as possible (up to additive lower-order terms) and often achieve statistical thresholds or conjectured computational thresholds. Our algorithm recovers the best known bounds for community detection in the sparse stochastic block model, a widely-studied class of estimation problems for community detection in graphs. We obtain the first recovery guarantees for the mixed-membership stochastic block model (Airoldi et el.) in constant average degree graphs---up to what we conjecture to be the computational threshold for this model. We show that our algorithm exhibits a sharp computational threshold for the stochastic block model with multiple communities beyond the Kesten--Stigum bound---giving evidence that this task may require exponential time. The basic strategy of our algorithm is strikingly simple: we compute the best-possible low-degree approximation for the moments of the posterior distribution of the parameters and use a robust tensor decomposition algorithm to recover the parameters from these approximate posterior moments."

Tensor methods have the potential to efficiently parametrize over-complete representations by leveraging this redundancy. In this paper, we propose to fully parametrize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a single high-order, low-rank tensor. Previous works on network tensorization have focused on parametrizing individual layers (convolutional or fully connected) only, and perform the tensorization layer-by-layer separately. In contrast, we propose to jointly capture the full structure of a neural network by parametrizing it with a single high-order tensor, the modes of which represent each of the architectural design parameters of the network (e.g. number of convolutional blocks, depth, number of stacks, input features, etc). This parametrization allows to regularize the whole network and drastically reduce the number of parameters. Our model is end-to-end trainable and the low-rank structure imposed on the weight tensor acts as an implicit regularization. We study the case of networks with rich structure, namely Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), which we propose to parametrize with a single 8th-order tensor.

In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptive Network Embedding framework, which applies graph convolutional network to learn transferable embeddings. In DANE, nodes from multiple networks are encoded to vectors via a shared set of learnable parameters so that the vectors share an aligned embedding space. The distribution of embeddings on different networks are further aligned by adversarial learning regularization. In addition, DANE's advantage in learning transferable network embedding can be guaranteed theoretically. Extensive experiments reflect that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art network embedding baselines in cross-network domain adaptation tasks."

Homomorphic encryption is one such paradigm that allows running arbitrary operations on encrypted data. It enables us to run any sophisticated machine learning algorithm without access to the underlying raw data. Thus, homomorphic learning provides the ability to gain insights from sensitive data that has been neglected due to various governmental and organization privacy rules. In this paper, we trace back the ideas of homomorphic learning formally posed by Ronald L. Rivest and Len Alderman as \"Can we compute upon encrypted data?\" in their 1978 paper. Then we gradually follow the ideas sprouting in the brilliant minds of Shafi Goldwasser, Kristin Lauter, Dan Bonch, Tomas Sander, Donald Beaver, and Craig Gentry to address that vital question.

For evaluating such predictions, the set of predicted labels needs to be compared to the ground-truth label set associated with that instance, and various loss functions have been proposed for this purpose. In addition to assessing predictive accuracy, a key concern in this regard is to foster and to analyze a learner's ability to capture label dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a new class of loss functions for multi-label classification, which overcome disadvantages of commonly used losses such as Hamming and subset 0/1. To this end, we leverage the mathematical framework of non-additive measures and integrals. Roughly speaking, a non-additive measure allows for modeling the importance of correct predictions of label subsets (instead of single labels), and thereby their impact on the overall evaluation, in a flexible way - by giving full importance to single labels and the entire label set, respectively, Hamming and subset 0/1 are rather extreme in this regard. We present concrete instantiations of this class, which comprise Hamming and subset 0/1 as special cases, and which appear to be especially appealing from a modeling perspective. The assessment of multi-label classifiers in terms of these losses is illustrated in an empirical study."

The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation, college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of 15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features, we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk estimation."

In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a TCS system. For the sensing matrix design in TCS, an extended separable approach with a closed form solution and a novel iterative non-separable method are proposed when the multilinear dictionary is fixed. In addition, a multidimensional dictionary learning method that takes advantages of the multidimensional structure is derived, and the influence of sensing matrices is taken into account in the learning process.

For example, with merely 30 hashed values per data point, b-bit minwise hashing can achieve similar accuracies as VW with 2^14 hashed values per data point. We demonstrate that the preprocessing cost of b-bit minwise hashing is roughly on the same order of magnitude as the data loading time. Furthermore, by using a GPU, the preprocessing cost can be reduced to a small fraction of the data loading time. Minwise hashing has been widely used in industry, at least in the context of search. One reason for its popularity is that one can efficiently simulate permutations by (e.g.,) universal hashing. In other words, there is no need to store the permutation matrix. In this paper, we empirically verify this practice, by demonstrating that even using the simplest 2-universal hashing does not degrade the learning performance."

While improving the different components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies, estimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked in the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the benefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions. This is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the generated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system as before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be small in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual prediction of unobserved revenue. The impact on revenue is then the difference between the observed and the estimated revenue. The originality of this work lies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for macroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the approach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for origin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and after a change in the system is applied. We report results using real large-scale data from Air Canada. We compare a deep neural network counterfactual predictions model with econometric models.

Especially pointing gestures are necessary to dissolve ambiguities in a scene and they are of crucial importance when verbal communication may fail due to environmental conditions or when two persons simply do not speak the same language. With the currently increasing advances of humanoid robots and their future integration in domestic domains, the development of gesture interfaces complementing human-robot interaction scenarios is of substantial interest. The implementation of an intuitive gesture scenario is still challenging because both the pointing intention and the corresponding object have to be correctly recognized in real-time. The demand increases when considering pointing gestures in a cluttered environment, as is the case in households. Also, humans perform pointing in many different ways and those variations have to be captured. Research in this field often proposes a set of geometrical computations which do not scale well with the number of gestures and objects, use specific markers or a predefined set of pointing directions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to model the distribution of pointing gestures using a growing-when-required (GWR) network.

To achieve this goal, we cast the problem into a constrained rank minimization framework by adopting the least squares regularization. Naturally, the data label structure tends to resemble that of the corresponding low-dimensional representation, which is derived from the robust subspace projection of clean data by low-rank learning. Moreover, the low-dimensional representation of original data can be paired with some informative structure by imposing an appropriate constraint, e.g., Laplacian regularizer. Therefore, we propose a novel constrained LRR method.

        "abstract_text": "Prior studies have unveiled the vulnerability of the deep neural networks in the context of adversarial machine learning, leading to great recent attention into this area. One interesting question that has yet to be fully explored is the bias-variance relationship of adversarial machine learning, which can potentially provide deeper insights into this behaviour. The notion of bias and variance is one of the main approaches to analyze and evaluate the generalization and reliability of a machine learning model. Although it has been extensively used in other machine learning models, it is not well explored in the field of deep learning and it is even less explored in the area of adversarial machine learning. In this study, we investigate the effect of adversarial machine learning on the bias and variance of a trained deep neural network and analyze how adversarial perturbations can affect the generalization of a network. We derive the bias-variance trade-off for both classification and regression applications based on two main loss functions: (i) mean squared error (MSE), and (ii) cross-entropy. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis with both simulated and real data to empirically evaluate consistency with the derived bias-variance tradeoffs. Our analysis sheds light on why the deep neural networks have poor performance under adversarial perturbation from a bias-variance point of view and how this type of perturbation would change the performance of a network."

In this paper, we question the adequacy of the standard design of sequence SSVAEs for the task of text classification as we exhibit two sources of overcomplexity for which we provide simplifications. These simplifications to SSVAEs preserve their theoretical soundness while providing a number of practical advantages in the semi-supervised setup where the result of training is a text classifier. These simplifications are the removal of (i) the Kullback-Liebler divergence from its objective and (ii) the fully unobserved latent variable from its probabilistic model. These changes relieve users from choosing a prior for their latent variables, make the model smaller and faster, and allow for a better flow of information into the latent variables. We compare the simplified versions to standard SSVAEs on 4 text classification tasks. On top of the above-mentioned simplification, experiments show a speed-up of 26%, while keeping equivalent classification scores. The code to reproduce our experiments is public."

The proposed method supports part exchange between 3D point cloud models and composition by different parts to form new models by directly editing latent representations. This holistic approach does not need part-based training to learn part representations and does not introduce any extra loss besides the standard reconstruction loss. The experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method with different object categories and varying number of points.

The malicious user probes its unique copy of the model to search for adversarial samples, presenting found samples to the victim's model in order to replicate the attack. By distributing different copies of the model to different users, we can mitigate such attacks wherein adversarial samples found on one copy would not work on another copy. We propose a flexible parameter rewriting method that directly modifies the model's parameters. This method does not require training and is able to generate a large number of copies, where each copy induces different sets of adversarial samples.

Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the parameters and 1/10 of the FLOPs.

While in practice, there is a graph where attributes of only partial nodes could be available and those of the others might be entirely missing. This attribute-missing graph is related to numerous real-world applications and there are limited studies investigating the corresponding learning problems. Existing graph learning methods including the popular GNN cannot provide satisfied learning performance since they are not specified for attribute-missing graphs. Thereby, designing a new GNN for these graphs is a burning issue to the graph learning community. In this paper, we make a shared-latent space assumption on graphs and develop a novel distribution matching based GNN called structure-attribute transformer (SAT) for attribute-missing graphs. SAT leverages structures and attributes in a decoupled scheme and achieves the joint distribution modeling of structures and attributes by distribution matching techniques. It could not only perform the link prediction task but also the newly introduced node attribute completion task. Furthermore, practical measures are introduced to quantify the performance of node attribute completion. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets indicate SAT shows better performance than other methods on both link prediction and node attribute completion tasks.

We, however, circumvent the subtraction problem by restricting our attention to stable instances, which intuitively are instances where a nearly optimal solution remains nearly optimal if the points are perturbed slightly. We give an efficient algorithm that computes a ``pseudo-gradient'' that guarantees convergence for stable instances at a rate comparable to that achieved by using the actual gradient.

To remove the need for the parallel training corpora has practical significance for real-world applications, and it is one of the main goals of unsupervised learning. Recently, encouraging progress in unsupervised learning for solving such classification problems has been made and the nature of the challenges has been clarified. In this article, we review this progress and disseminate a class of promising new methods to facilitate understanding the methods for machine learning researchers. In particular, we emphasize the key information that enables the success of unsupervised learning - the sequential statistics as the distributional prior in the labels. Exploitation of such sequential statistics makes it possible to estimate parameters of classifiers without the need of paired input-output data. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Caesar Cipher and its decryption, which motivated the construction of the novel loss function for unsupervised learning we use throughout the paper. Then we use a simple but representative binary classification task as an example to derive and describe the unsupervised learning algorithm in a step-by-step, easy-to-understand fashion.

The model learns solutions that satisfy, up to an arbitrarily small error, Hamilton's equations and, therefore, conserve the Hamiltonian invariants. The choice of an appropriate activation function drastically improves the predictability of the network. Moreover, an error analysis is derived and states that the numerical errors depend on the overall network performance. The Hamiltonian network is then employed to solve the equations for the nonlinear oscillator and the chaotic Henon-Heiles dynamical system. In both systems, a symplectic Euler integrator requires two orders more evaluation points than the Hamiltonian network in order to achieve the same order of the numerical error in the predicted phase space trajectories."

In response, we develop a new family of unsupervised sampling methods for selecting hard negative samples where the user can control the hardness. A limiting case of this sampling results in a representation that tightly clusters each class, and pushes different classes as far apart as possible. The proposed method improves downstream performance across multiple modalities, requires only few additional lines of code to implement, and introduces no computational overhead."

Owing to the limited number of anomaly labels in these complex systems, unsupervised anomaly detection methods have attracted great attention in recent years. Two major challenges faced by the existing unsupervised methods are: (i) distinguishing between normal and abnormal data in the transition field, where normal and abnormal data are highly mixed together; (ii) defining an effective metric to maximize the gap between normal and abnormal data in a hypothesis space, which is built by a representation learner. To that end, this work proposes a novel scoring network with a score-guided regularization to learn and enlarge the anomaly score disparities between normal and abnormal data. With such score-guided strategy, the representation learner can gradually learn more informative representation during the model training stage, especially for the samples in the transition field.

Prior research has mainly focused on fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute, with intersectional fairness being comparatively less studied despite its critical importance for the safety of modern machine learning systems. We present a comprehensive framework for auditing and achieving intersectional fairness in classification problems: we define a suite of metrics to assess intersectional fairness in the data or model outputs by extending known single-attribute fairness metrics, and propose methods for robustly estimating them even when some intersectional subgroups are underrepresented. Furthermore, we develop post-processing techniques to mitigate any detected intersectional bias in a classification model.

We demonstrate that it is mathematically possible to achieve perfect (error-free) inference using only $N$ designed training patterns, but this is computationally unfeasible for large systems.

However, it is only applicable for training data containing only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves, which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom layers.

Additionally, for the 3D latent architecture, we discovered that the resulting latent vectors were strongly clustered spontaneously into one of 14 clusters. Kmeans was then used only to identify members of each cluster and to inspect cluster properties.

To address this problem, we propose a novel framework Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN for synthesizing images from input text.

        "abstract_text": "Variational inference is computationally challenging in models that contain both conjugate and non-conjugate terms. Methods specifically designed for conjugate models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to deal with non-conjugate terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods can handle the non-conjugate terms but they usually ignore the conjugate structure of the model which might result in slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference (CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the methods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model."

        "abstract_text": "The success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision applications has been accompanied by a significant increase of computation and memory costs, which prohibits its usage on resource-limited environments such as mobile or embedded devices. To this end, the research of CNN compression has recently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning scheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously speedup the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be well supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely, the proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured sparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully coordinates the global outputs and local pruning operations to adaptively prune filters. We further propose an Alternative Updating with Lagrange Multipliers (AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle of ADMM and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and optimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5x to the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based regularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online inference is extremely memory-light, since the number of filters and the output feature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures including LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet and GoogLeNet over different datasets. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."

Often, this is addressed in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the aim is to decompose a policy into lower-level primitives or options, and a higher-level meta-policy that triggers the appropriate behaviors for a given situation. However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization."

In this work, we propose a new CPE algorithm in the PAC setting, which is computationally light weight, and so can easily be applied to problems with tens of thousands of arms. This is achieved since the proposed algorithm requires a very small number of combinatorial oracle calls. The algorithm is based on successive acceptance of arms, along with elimination which is based on the combinatorial structure of the problem. We provide sample complexity guarantees for our algorithm, and demonstrate in experiments its usefulness on large problems, whereas previous algorithms are impractical to run on problems of even a few dozen arms.

However, doing this accurately is a difficult task due to the black-box nature of such networks. Most existing approaches find such attributions either using activations and gradients or by repeatedly perturbing the input. We instead address this challenge by training a second deep network, the Explainer, to predict attributions for a pre-trained black-box classifier, the Explanandum. These attributions are in the form of masks that only show the classifier-relevant parts of an image, masking out the rest. Our approach produces sharper and more boundary-precise masks when compared to the saliency maps generated by other methods. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches, ours is capable of directly generating very distinct class-specific masks. Finally, the proposed method is very efficient for inference since it only takes a single forward pass through the Explainer to generate all class-specific masks. We show that our attributions are superior to established methods both visually and quantitatively, by evaluating them on the PASCAL VOC-2007 and Microsoft COCO-2014 datasets."

FL allows the clients to participate in the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their local data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead, where the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central server at each global training round. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been recently proposed to alleviate the communication bottleneck where the model updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple-access channel. However, simple averaging of the model updates via AirComp makes the learning process vulnerable to random or intended modifications of the local model updates of some Byzantine clients. In this paper, we propose a transmission and aggregation framework to reduce the effect of such attacks while preserving the benefits of AirComp for FL. For the proposed robust approach, the central server divides the participating clients randomly into groups and allocates a transmission time slot for each group. The updates of the different groups are then aggregated using a robust aggregation technique. We extend our approach to handle the case of non-i.i.d. local data, where a resampling step is added before robust aggregation. We analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for both cases of i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution."

A common method for alleviating this issue is to combine per-task gradients into a joint update direction using a particular heuristic. In this paper, we propose viewing the gradients combination step as a bargaining game, where tasks negotiate to reach an agreement on a joint direction of parameter update. Under certain assumptions, the bargaining problem has a unique solution, known as the Nash Bargaining Solution, which we propose to use as a principled approach to multi-task learning.

COBRA preserves agent privacy and retains interaction contexts via the machine learning models, and achieves more accurate trust prediction than a fully-connected neural network alternative. COBRA is also robust to security attacks by agents who inject fake machine learning models; notably, it is resistant to the 51-percent attack.

Therefore, we define a novel generic framework for attributional robustness (FAR) as general problem formulation for training models with robust attributions. This framework consist of a generic regularization term and training objective that minimize the maximal dissimilarity of attribution maps in a local neighbourhood of the input. We show that FAR is a generalized, less constrained formulation of currently existing training methods. We then propose two new instantiations of this framework, AAT and AdvAAT, that directly optimize for both robust attributions and predictions. Experiments performed on widely used vision datasets show that our methods perform better or comparably to current ones in terms of attributional robustness while being more generally applicable.

However, such reliance on domain-specific knowledge renders these methods inapplicable to other domains. While Manifold Mixup based task augmentation methods are domain-agnostic, we empirically find them ineffective on non-image domains. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel domain-agnostic task augmentation method, Meta-Interpolation, which utilizes expressive neural set functions to densify the meta-training task distribution using bilevel optimization. We empirically validate the efficacy of Meta-Interpolation on eight datasets spanning across various domains such as image classification, molecule property prediction, text classification and speech recognition.

The three NLP models are based on regularized logistic regression and use different sets of features including positive mention of concept unique identifiers (CUIs), number of appearances of CUIs, and a mixture of three components respectively. The baseline algorithm and the best performed NLP algorithm were external validated on a dataset from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)."

As in many fields within the natural and engineering sciences, the systems under study typically evolve continuously in time, it is natural to consider continuous-time model formulations consisting of switching stochastic differential equations governed by an underlying Markov jump process. Inference in these types of models is however notoriously difficult, and tractable computational schemes are rare. In this work, we propose a novel inference algorithm utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. The presented Gibbs sampler allows to efficiently obtain samples from the exact continuous-time posterior processes. Our framework naturally enables Bayesian parameter estimation, and we also include an estimate for the diffusion covariance, which is oftentimes assumed fixed in stochastic differential equation models. We evaluate our framework under the modeling assumption and compare it against an existing variational inference approach."

        "abstract_text": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become central for characterizing structures of complex networks and performing tasks such as link prediction, node classification, network reconstruction, and community detection. Whereas numerous generative GRL models have been proposed, many approaches have prohibitive computational requirements hampering large-scale network analysis, fewer are able to explicitly account for structure emerging at multiple scales, and only a few explicitly respect important network properties such as homophily and transitivity. This paper proposes a novel scalable graph representation learning method named the Hierarchical Block Distance Model (HBDM). The HBDM imposes a multiscale block structure akin to stochastic block modeling (SBM) and accounts for homophily and transitivity by accurately approximating the latent distance model (LDM) throughout the inferred hierarchy. The HBDM naturally accommodates unipartite, directed, and bipartite networks whereas the hierarchy is designed to ensure linearithmic time and space complexity enabling the analysis of very large-scale networks. We evaluate the performance of the HBDM on massive networks consisting of millions of nodes. Importantly, we find that the proposed HBDM framework significantly outperforms recent scalable approaches in all considered downstream tasks. Surprisingly, we observe superior performance even imposing ultra-low two-dimensional embeddings facilitating accurate direct and hierarchical-aware network visualization and interpretation."

While state-of-the-art ASC models have achieved remarkable performance, they are recently shown to suffer from the issue of robustness. Particularly in two common scenarios: when domains of test and training data are different (out-of-domain scenario) or test data is adversarially perturbed (adversarial scenario), ASC models may attend to irrelevant words and neglect opinion expressions that truly describe diverse aspects. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we hypothesize that position bias (i.e., the words closer to a concerning aspect would carry a higher degree of importance) is crucial for building more robust ASC models by reducing the probability of mis-attending. Accordingly, we propose two mechanisms for capturing position bias, namely position-biased weight and position-biased dropout, which can be flexibly injected into existing models to enhance representations for classification. Experiments conducted on out-of-domain and adversarial datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches largely improve the robustness and effectiveness of current models."

These sketches erase gracefully; even if we erase a fraction of the sketch at random, the remainder still retains the `high-weight' information present in the original sketch. The sketches can also be organized in a repository to implicitly form a `knowledge graph'; it is possible to quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a sketch of interest; arranged in this fashion, the sketches can also be used to learn emerging concepts by looking for new clusters in sketch space. Finally, in the scenario where we want to learn a ground truth deep network, we show that augmenting input/output pairs with these sketches can theoretically make it easier to do so."

The typical way of conducting multi-task learning with deep neural networks is either through handcrafted schemes that share all initial layers and branch out at an adhoc point, or through separate task-specific networks with an additional feature sharing/fusion mechanism. Unlike existing methods, we propose an adaptive sharing approach, called AdaShare, that decides what to share across which tasks to achieve the best recognition accuracy, while taking resource efficiency into account. Specifically, our main idea is to learn the sharing pattern through a task-specific policy that selectively chooses which layers to execute for a given task in the multi-task network. We efficiently optimize the task-specific policy jointly with the network weights, using standard back-propagation. Experiments on several challenging and diverse benchmark datasets with a variable number of tasks well demonstrate the efficacy of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

We use the Nystrom approximation to obtain data dependent eigenfunctions and select these eigenfunctions by evidence maximization. This selection reduces the number of eigenfunctions in our model and provides a nonstationary covariance function. To handle nonlinear likelihoods, we develop an efficient expectation propagation (EP) inference algorithm, and couple it with expectation maximization for eigenfunction selection. Because the eigenfunctions of a Gaussian kernel are associated with clusters of samples - including both the labeled and unlabeled - selecting relevant eigenfunctions enables EigenGP to conduct semi-supervised learning. Our experimental results demonstrate improved predictive performance of EigenGP over alternative state-of-the-art sparse GP and semisupervised learning methods for regression, classification, and semisupervised classification."

While a full answer depends on the type of signal, correlation of signals, and desired output, a problem common to all of these applications is that of differentiating sources based on their quality and weighting them accordingly. It is often assumed that this differentiation and aggregation is done by a single, accurate central mechanism or agent (e.g. judge). We complicate this model in two ways. First, we investigate the setting with both a single judge, and one with multiple judges. Second, given this multi-agent interaction of judges, we investigate various constraints on the judges' reporting space. We build on known results for the optimal weighting of experts and prove that an ensemble of sub-optimal mechanisms can perform optimally under certain conditions. We then show empirically that the ensemble approximates the performance of the optimal mechanism under a broader range of conditions."

Moreover, numerical methods to compute empirical estimates of these embeddings are akin to data-driven methods for the approximation of transfer operators such as extended dynamic mode decomposition and its variants. One main benefit of the presented kernel-based approaches is that these methods can be applied to any domain where a similarity measure given by a kernel is available.

For example, a fraud detection model in online payments could show a drift due to a hot sale item (with an increase in false positives) or due to a true fraud attack (with an increase in false negatives) before labels are available. In this paper we propose SAMM, an automatic model monitoring system for data streams. SAMM detects concept drift using a time and space efficient unsupervised streaming algorithm and it generates alarm reports with a summary of the events and features that are important to explain it. SAMM was evaluated in five real world fraud detection datasets, each spanning periods up to eight months and totaling more than 22 million online transactions. We evaluated SAMM using human feedback from domain experts, by sending them 100 reports generated by the system. Our results show that SAMM is able to detect anomalous events in a model life cycle that are considered useful by the domain experts. Given these results, SAMM will be rolled out in a next version of Feedzai's Fraud Detection solution."

We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively decoding and encoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Since, the generative model learns to map from the learned latent distribution, rather than the prior, we may use MCMC to improve the quality of samples drawn from the generative model, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we are able to reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without a denoising criterion."

CT uses harmful ionising radiation, and MRI suffers from slow acquisition speed. Both problems can be tackled by undersampling, such as sparse sampling. However, such undersampled data leads to lower resolution and introduces artefacts. Several techniques, including deep learning based methods, have been proposed to reconstruct such data. However, the undersampled reconstruction problem for these two modalities was always considered as two different problems and tackled separately by different research works. This paper proposes a unified solution for both sparse CT and undersampled radial MRI reconstruction, achieved by applying Fourier transform-based pre-processing on the radial MRI and then reconstructing both modalities using sinogram upsampling combined with filtered back-projection. The Primal-Dual network is a deep learning based method for reconstructing sparsely-sampled CT data. This paper introduces Primal-Dual UNet, which improves the Primal-Dual network in terms of accuracy and reconstruction speed. The proposed method resulted in an average SSIM of 0.932 while performing sparse CT reconstruction for fan-beam geometry with a sparsity level of 16, achieving a statistically significant improvement over the previous model, which resulted in 0.919. Furthermore, the proposed model resulted in 0.903 and 0.957 average SSIM while reconstructing undersampled brain and abdominal MRI data with an acceleration factor of 16 - statistically significant improvements over the original model, which resulted in 0.867 and 0.949."

For autonomous agents to have this capability, they must be able to extract reusable skills from past experience that can be recombined in new ways for subsequent tasks. Furthermore, when controlling complex high-dimensional morphologies, such as humanoid bodies, tasks often require coordination of multiple skills simultaneously. Learning discrete primitives for every combination of skills quickly becomes prohibitive. Composable primitives that can be recombined to create a large variety of behaviors can be more suitable for modeling this combinatorial explosion. In this work, we propose multiplicative compositional policies (MCP), a method for learning reusable motor skills that can be composed to produce a range of complex behaviors. Our method factorizes an agent's skills into a collection of primitives, where multiple primitives can be activated simultaneously via multiplicative composition. This flexibility allows the primitives to be transferred and recombined to elicit new behaviors as necessary for novel tasks. We demonstrate that MCP is able to extract composable skills for highly complex simulated characters from pre-training tasks, such as motion imitation, and then reuse these skills to solve challenging continuous control tasks, such as dribbling a soccer ball to a goal, and picking up an object and transporting it to a target location."

Although the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal expected employment compared to the hindsight-optimal solution (and improves upon the status quo procedure by about 40%), it results in a periodically imbalanced allocation to the localities over time. This leads to undesirable workload inefficiencies for resettlement resources and agents. To address this problem, the second algorithm balances the goal of improving refugee outcomes with the desire for an even allocation over time. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated using real refugee resettlement data from a large resettlement agency in the United States. On this dataset, we find that the allocation balancing algorithm can achieve near-perfect balance over time with only a small loss in expected employment compared to the pure employment-maximizing algorithm. In addition, the allocation balancing algorithm offers a number of ancillary benefits compared to pure outcome-maximization, including robustness to unknown arrival flows and greater exploration."

While there have been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years, tracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a ball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task. Existing spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small objects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the maskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state produced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object's predicted bounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the underlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the hidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of exploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the network by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located. Our experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that are small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving objects."

The second part includes corpus taken manually from movies, TV series, and variety shows, consisting of 10 emotions and three modalities (facial expression, body posture, and emotional speech). HEU Emotion is by far the most extensive multi-modal emotional database with 9,951 subjects. In order to provide a benchmark for emotion recognition, we used many conventional machine learning and deep learning methods to evaluate HEU Emotion. We proposed a Multi-modal Attention module to fuse multi-modal features adaptively. After multi-modal fusion, the recognition accuracies for the two parts increased by 2.19% and 4.01% respectively over those of single-modal facial expression recognition."

        "abstract_text": "Representing data residing on a graph as a linear combination of building block signals can enable efficient and insightful visual or statistical analysis of the data, and such representations prove useful as regularizers in signal processing and machine learning tasks. Designing collections of building block signals -- or more formally, dictionaries of atoms -- that specifically account for the underlying graph structure as well as any available representative training signals has been an active area of research over the last decade. In this article, we survey a particular class of dictionaries called localized spectral graph filter frames, whose atoms are created by localizing spectral patterns to different regions of the graph. After showing how this class encompasses a variety of approaches from spectral graph wavelets to graph filter banks, we focus on the two main questions of how to design the spectral filters and how to select the center vertices to which the patterns are localized. Throughout, we emphasize computationally efficient methods that ensure the resulting transforms and their inverses can be applied to data residing on large, sparse graphs. We demonstrate how this class of transform methods can be used in signal processing tasks such as denoising and non-linear approximation, and provide code for readers to experiment with these methods in new application domains."

In this paper, we consider invariant and equivariant networks for symmetries of finite groups. Invariant and equivariant networks have been constructed by various researchers using Reynolds operators. However, Reynolds operators are computationally expensive when the order of the group is large because they use the sum over the whole group, which poses an implementation difficulty. To overcome this difficulty, we consider representing the Reynolds operator as a sum over a subset instead of a sum over the whole group. We call such a subset a Reynolds design, and an operator defined by a sum over a Reynolds design a reductive Reynolds operator. For example, in the case of a graph with $n$ nodes, the computational complexity of the reductive Reynolds operator is reduced to $O(n^2)$, while the computational complexity of the Reynolds operator is $O(n!)$. We construct learning models based on the reductive Reynolds operator called equivariant and invariant Reynolds networks (ReyNets) and prove that they have universal approximation property. Reynolds designs for equivariant ReyNets are derived from combinatorial observations with Young diagrams, while Reynolds designs for invariant ReyNets are derived from invariants called Reynolds dimensions defined on the set of invariant polynomials. Numerical experiments show that the performance of our models is comparable to state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract_text": "Despite achieving remarkable success in various domains, recent studies have uncovered the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations, creating concerns on model generalizability and new threats such as prediction-evasive misclassification or stealthy reprogramming. Among different defense proposals, stochastic network defenses such as random neuron activation pruning or random perturbation to layer inputs are shown to be promising for attack mitigation. However, one critical drawback of current defenses is that the robustness enhancement is at the cost of noticeable performance degradation on legitimate data, e.g., large drop in test accuracy. This paper is motivated by pursuing for a better trade-off between adversarial robustness and test accuracy for stochastic network defenses. We propose Defense Efficiency Score (DES), a comprehensive metric that measures the gain in unsuccessful attack attempts at the cost of drop in test accuracy of any defense. To achieve a better DES, we propose hierarchical random switching (HRS), which protects neural networks through a novel randomization scheme. A HRS-protected model contains several blocks of randomly switching channels to prevent adversaries from exploiting fixed model structures and parameters for their malicious purposes. Extensive experiments show that HRS is superior in defending against state-of-the-art white-box and adaptive adversarial misclassification attacks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HRS in defending adversarial reprogramming, which is the first defense against adversarial programs. Moreover, in most settings the average DES of HRS is at least 5X higher than current stochastic network defenses, validating its significantly improved robustness-accuracy trade-off."

For the problem of label efficient prediction, which is a budgeted version of prediction with expert advice, we present an online algorithm whose regret depends optimally on the number of labels allowed and $Q^*$ (the quadratic variation of the losses of the best action in hindsight), along with a parameter-free counterpart whose regret depends optimally on $Q$ (the quadratic variation of the losses of all the actions). These quantities can be significantly smaller than $T$ (the total time horizon), yielding an improvement over existing, variation-independent results for the problem. We then extend our analysis to handle label efficient prediction with bandit feedback, i.e., label efficient bandits. Our work builds upon the framework of optimistic online mirror descent, and leverages second order corrections along with a carefully designed hybrid regularizer that encodes the constrained information structure of the problem. We then consider revealing action-partial monitoring games -- a version of label efficient prediction with additive information costs, which in general are known to lie in the \\textit{hard} class of games having minimax regret of order $T^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. We provide a strategy with an $\\mathcal{O}((Q^*T)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for revealing action games, along with one with a $\\mathcal{O}((QT)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for the full class of hard partial monitoring games, both being strict improvements over current bounds."

In this work, we extend MEKA to be applicable not only for shift-invariant kernels but also for non-stationary kernels like polynomial kernels and an extreme learning kernel. We also address in detail how to handle non-positive semi-definite kernel functions within MEKA, either caused by the approximation itself or by the intentional use of general kernel functions.

We present several objectives for two separate weakly supervised tasks, machine translation and semantic parsing. We show that objectives should actively discourage negative outputs in addition to promoting a surrogate gold structure. This notion of bipolarity is naturally present in ramp loss objectives, which we adapt to neural models. We show that bipolar ramp loss objectives outperform other non-bipolar ramp loss objectives and minimum risk training (MRT) on both weakly supervised tasks, as well as on a supervised machine translation task. Additionally, we introduce a novel token-level ramp loss objective, which is able to outperform even the best sequence-level ramp loss on both weakly supervised tasks."

The numerical methods that we develop take advantage of the ability of physics-informed neural networks to easily implement high-order numerical schemes to efficiently solve PDEs. We then show how recently introduced adaptive techniques for spectral methods can be integrated into PINN-based PDE solvers to obtain numerical solutions of unbounded domain problems that cannot be efficiently approximated by standard PINNs.

With typical errors between 20 % and 30 % of the 3D signal, neural networks improve Tripleclouds' accuracy for about 1 % increase in runtime. Thus, rather than emulating the whole of SPARTACUS, we keep Tripleclouds unchanged for cloud-free parts of the atmosphere and 3D-correct it elsewhere. The focus on the comparably small 3D correction instead of the entire signal allows us to improve predictions significantly if we assume a similar signal-to-noise ratio for both."

One of the objectives of such demand response management is to incentivize the consumers to adjust their consumption so that the overall electricity procurement in the wholesale markets is minimized, e.g. it is desirable that consumers consume less during peak hours when cost of procurement for brokers from wholesale markets are high. We consider a greedy solution to maximize the overall profit for brokers by optimal tariff profile allocation. This in-turn requires forecasting electricity consumption for each user for all tariff profiles. This forecasting problem is challenging compared to standard forecasting problems due to following reasons: i. the number of possible combinations of hourly tariffs is high and retailers may not have considered all combinations in the past resulting in a biased set of tariff profiles tried in the past, ii. the profiles allocated in the past to each user is typically based on certain policy. These reasons violate the standard i.i.d. assumptions, as there is a need to evaluate new tariff profiles on existing customers and historical data is biased by the policies used in the past for tariff allocation. In this work, we consider several scenarios for forecasting and optimization under these conditions. We leverage the underlying structure of how consumers respond to variable tariff rates by comparing tariffs across hours and shifting loads, and propose suitable inductive biases in the design of deep neural network based architectures for forecasting under such scenarios."

Finally, we achieve a higher level of interpretability by imposing OCCAM on the objects represented in the induced symbolic concept space. Our model design makes this an easy adaption via first predicting the concepts of objects and relations and then projecting the predicted concepts back to the visual feature space so the compositional reasoning module can process normally. Experiments on the CLEVR and GQA datasets demonstrate: 1) our OCCAM achieves a new state of the art without human-annotated functional programs; 2) our induced concepts are both accurate and sufficient as OCCAM achieves an on-par performance on objects represented either in visual features or in the induced symbolic concept space."

When the the comparison set and the adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -> infinity. Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the comparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we analyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly T/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of all: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate. We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty function. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of regret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set in advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{e} as T ->infinity; we give a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T.

We study both the classical price-based network revenue management problem in the distributionally-unknown setup, and the bandits with knapsacks problem. In these problems, a decision-maker (without prior knowledge of the environment) has finite initial inventory of multiple resources to allocate over a finite time horizon. Beyond the classical resource constraints, we introduce an additional switching constraint to these problems, which restricts the total number of times that the decision-maker makes switches between actions to be within a fixed switching budget. For such problems, we show matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal regret, and propose computationally-efficient limited-switch algorithms that achieve the optimal regret. Our work reveals a surprising result: the optimal regret rate is completely characterized by a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, which further depends on the number of resource constraints -- to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the number of resources constraints is shown to play a fundamental role in determining the statistical complexity of online learning problems.

We give a detailed analysis of our new technique, including general guarantees based on R\\'enyi divergences, and learning bounds when conditional Maxent is used for estimating conditional probabilities for a point to belong to a source domain. We show that these guarantees compare favorably to those that can be derived for the generative solution, using kernel density estimation.

        "abstract_text": "The Greedy algorithm is the simplest heuristic in sequential decision problem that carelessly takes the locally optimal choice at each round, disregarding any advantages of exploring and/or information gathering. Theoretically, it is known to sometimes have poor performances, for instance even a linear regret (with respect to the time horizon) in the standard multi-armed bandit problem. On the other hand, this heuristic performs reasonably well in practice and it even has sublinear, and even near-optimal, regret bounds in some very specific linear contextual and Bayesian bandit models. We build on a recent line of work and investigate bandit settings where the number of arms is relatively large and where simple greedy algorithms enjoy highly competitive performance, both in theory and in practice. We first provide a generic worst-case bound on the regret of the Greedy algorithm. When combined with some arms subsampling, we prove that it verifies near-optimal worst-case regret bounds in continuous, infinite and many-armed bandit problems. Moreover, for shorter time spans, the theoretical relative suboptimality of Greedy is even reduced. As a consequence, we subversively claim that for many interesting problems and associated horizons, the best compromise between theoretical guarantees, practical performances and computational burden is definitely to follow the greedy heuristic. We support our claim by many numerical experiments that show significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art, even for moderately long time horizon."

We learn data-driven generative models of human movement using autoregressive conditional variational autoencoders, or Motion VAEs. The latent variables of the learned autoencoder define the action space for the movement and thereby govern its evolution over time. Planning or control algorithms can then use this action space to generate desired motions. In particular, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn controllers that achieve goal-directed movements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on multiple tasks. We further evaluate system-design choices and describe the current limitations of Motion VAEs."

M4 models individual preferences as a user-specific probabilistic mixture of shared latent Mallows components. Our key algorithmic insight for estimation is to establish a statistical connection between M4 and topic models by viewing pairwise comparisons as words, and users as documents. This key insight leads us to explore Mallows components with a separable structure and leverage recent advances in separable topic discovery. While separability appears to be overly restrictive, we nevertheless show that it is an inevitable outcome of a relatively small number of latent Mallows components in a world of large number of items. We then develop an algorithm based on robust extreme-point identification of convex polygons to learn the reference rankings, and is provably consistent with polynomial sample complexity guarantees. We demonstrate that our new model is empirically competitive with the current state-of-the-art approaches in predicting real-world preferences."

In this exploratory study, we describe a new dataset consisting of conversation transcripts, post-visit summaries, corresponding supporting evidence (in the transcript), and structured labels. We focus on the tasks of recognizing relevant diagnoses and abnormalities in the review of organ systems (RoS). One methodological challenge is that the conversations are long (around 1500 words), making it difficult for modern deep-learning models to use them as input. To address this challenge, we extract noteworthy utterances---parts of the conversation likely to be cited as evidence supporting some summary sentence. We find that by first filtering for (predicted) noteworthy utterances, we can significantly boost predictive performance for recognizing both diagnoses and RoS abnormalities."

In this paper we introduce an architecture that learns with reinforcement to make decisions about whether to read a token or write another token. This architecture is able to transform potentially infinite sequences on-line. In an experimental study we compare it with state-of-the-art methods for neural machine translation.

These restrictions can be further complicated by potential variability in the communications budget, for example a solar-powered device needing to expend less energy when transmitting data on a cloudy day. We propose a novel, topology-based, lossy compression method well-equipped for these restrictive yet variable circumstances. This technique, Topological Signal Compression, allows sending compressed signals that utilize the entirety of a variable communications budget.

Despite a significantly improved performance due to approaches such as the identification of disentangled latent representations, contrastive learning, and clustering optimisations, the performance of unsupervised machine learning still falls short of its hypothesised potential. Machine learning has previously taken inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science with great success. However, this has mostly been based on adult learners with access to labels and a vast amount of prior knowledge. In order to push unsupervised machine learning forward, we argue that developmental science of infant cognition might hold the key to unlocking the next generation of unsupervised learning approaches. Conceptually, human infant learning is the closest biological parallel to artificial unsupervised learning, as infants too must learn useful representations from unlabelled data. In contrast to machine learning, these new representations are learned rapidly and from relatively few examples. Moreover, infants learn robust representations that can be used flexibly and efficiently in a number of different tasks and contexts. We identify five crucial factors enabling infants' quality and speed of learning, assess the extent to which these have already been exploited in machine learning, and propose how further adoption of these factors can give rise to previously unseen performance levels in unsupervised learning."

This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices. Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate Slalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU. For canonical DNNs (VGG16, MobileNet and ResNet variants) we obtain 6x to 20x increases in throughput for verifiable inference, and 4x to 11x for verifiable and private inference."

Conditioning mainly relies on prior belief maps, representing most likely moving directions and forcing the model to consider past observed dynamics in generating future positions. Human interactions are modeled with a graph-based attention mechanism enabling an online attentive hidden state refinement of the recurrent estimation. To corroborate our model, we perform extensive experiments on publicly-available datasets (e.g., ETH/UCY, Stanford Drone Dataset, STATS SportVU NBA, Intersection Drone Dataset and TrajNet++) and demonstrate its effectiveness in crowded scenes compared to several state-of-the-art methods."

We propose a novel reinforcement learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird games.

As expected, such training rapidly blows up network weights, but the net stays well-behaved due to normalization. 2. Mathematical explanation of the success of the above rate schedule: a rigorous proof that it is equivalent to the standard setting of BN + SGD + StandardRate Tuning + Weight Decay + Momentum. This equivalence holds for other normalization layers as well, Group Normalization, LayerNormalization, Instance Norm, etc. 3.

In this work, we introduce the Phased LSTM model, which extends the LSTM unit by adding a new time gate. This gate is controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency range that produces updates of the memory cell only during a small percentage of the cycle. Even with the sparse updates imposed by the oscillation, the Phased LSTM network achieves faster convergence than regular LSTMs on tasks which require learning of long sequences. The model naturally integrates inputs from sensors of arbitrary sampling rates, thereby opening new areas of investigation for processing asynchronous sensory events that carry timing information. It also greatly improves the performance of LSTMs in standard RNN applications, and does so with an order-of-magnitude fewer computes at runtime."

A novel cascaded ensemble of support vector machines (SVM) is used to effectively tackle the class imbalance and provide significant predictions. For True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.35, 0.69 and 0.82, the system generates only 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 False Positives/Image (FPI), respectively."

Efforts towards measuring different phenomena have gained traction in the AI community, as illustrated by the publication of several influential field reports and policy documents. These metrics are designed to help decision takers to inform themselves about the fast-moving and impacting influences of key advances in Artificial Intelligence in general and Machine Learning in particular. In this paper we propose to use such newfound capabilities of AI technologies to augment our AI measuring capabilities. We do so by training a model to classify publications related to ethical issues and concerns. In our methodology we use an expert, manually curated dataset as the training set and then evaluate a large set of research papers. Finally, we highlight the implications of AI metrics, in particular their contribution towards developing trustful and fair AI-based tools and technologies.

While there have been some attempts to hand-engineer novel activation functions, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) remains the most commonly-used in practice. This paper shows that evolutionary algorithms can discover novel activation functions that outperform ReLU. A tree-based search space of candidate activation functions is defined and explored with mutation, crossover, and exhaustive search. Experiments on training wide residual networks on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image datasets show that this approach is effective. Replacing ReLU with evolved activation functions results in statistically significant increases in network accuracy. Optimal performance is achieved when evolution is allowed to customize activation functions to a particular task; however, these novel activation functions are shown to generalize, achieving high performance across tasks. Evolutionary optimization of activation functions is therefore a promising new dimension of metalearning in neural networks."

Federated learning methods run training tasks directly on user devices and do not share the raw user data with third parties. However, current methods still share model updates, which may contain private information (e.g., one's weight and height), during the training process. Existing efforts that aim to improve the privacy of federated learning make compromises in one or more of the following key areas: performance (particularly communication cost), accuracy, or privacy. To better optimize these trade-offs, we propose that \\textit{sketching algorithms} have a unique advantage in that they can provide both privacy and performance benefits while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate the feasibility of sketching-based federated learning with a prototype on three representative learning models. Our initial findings show that it is possible to provide strong privacy guarantees for federated learning without sacrificing performance or accuracy. Our work highlights that there exists a fundamental connection between privacy and communication in distributed settings, and suggests important open problems surrounding the theoretical understanding, methodology, and system design of practical, private federated learning."

Model security allows system to behave as intended without being affected by malicious external influences that can compromise its integrity and efficiency. Security attacks can be divided based on when they occur: if an attack occurs during training, it is known as a poisoning attack, and if it occurs during inference (after training) it is termed an evasion attack. Poisoning attacks compromise the training process by corrupting the data with malicious examples, while evasion attacks use adversarial examples to disrupt entire classification process. Defenses proposed against such attacks include techniques to recognize and remove malicious data, train a model to be insensitive to such data, and mask the model's structure and parameters to render attacks more challenging to implement. Furthermore, the privacy of the data involved in model training is also threatened by attacks such as the model-inversion attack, or by dishonest service providers of AI applications. To maintain data privacy, several solutions that combine existing data-privacy techniques have been proposed, including differential privacy and modern cryptography techniques. In this paper, we describe the notions of some of methods, e.g., homomorphic encryption, and review their advantages and challenges when implemented in deep-learning models."

Standard approaches, which independently assess the informativeness of each triplet in a batch, are susceptible to highly correlated batches with many redundant triplets and hence low overall utility. While a recent work \\cite{kumari2020batch} proposes batch-decorrelation strategies for metric learning, they rely on ad hoc heuristics to estimate the correlation between two triplets at a time. We present a novel batch active metric learning method that leverages the Maximum Entropy Principle to learn the least biased estimate of triplet distribution for a given set of prior constraints. To avoid redundancy between triplets, our method collectively selects batches with maximum joint entropy, which simultaneously captures both informativeness and diversity. We take advantage of the submodularity of the joint entropy function to construct a tractable solution using an efficient greedy algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization that is provably $\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{e} \\right)$-optimal. Our approach is the first batch active metric learning method to define a unified score that balances informativeness and diversity for an entire batch of triplets. Experiments with several real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is robust, generalizes well to different applications and input modalities, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art."

Specifically, we consider the recently popularized objective function for hierarchical clustering due to Dasgupta. Previous algorithms for (approximately) minimizing this objective function require linear time/space complexity. In many applications the underlying graph can be massive in size making it computationally challenging to process the graph even using a linear time/space algorithm. As a result, there is a strong interest in designing algorithms that can perform global computation using only sublinear resources. The focus of this work is to study hierarchical clustering for massive graphs under three well-studied models of sublinear computation which focus on space, time, and communication, respectively, as the primary resources to optimize: (1) (dynamic) streaming model where edges are presented as a stream, (2) query model where the graph is queried using neighbor and degree queries, (3) MPC model where the graph edges are partitioned over several machines connected via a communication channel. We design sublinear algorithms for hierarchical clustering in all three models above. At the heart of our algorithmic results is a view of the objective in terms of cuts in the graph, which allows us to use a relaxed notion of cut sparsifiers to do hierarchical clustering while introducing only a small distortion in the objective function."

We found no significant improvement over unsmoothed data even when we set the smoothing parameter through cross validation. We are not claiming smoothing has no worth. It has an important role in exploratory analysis and helps with specific classification problems where domain knowledge can be exploited.

The relevant anchor point need not be the nearest anchor point to the ground truth location, as it might not be visible due to the pose. Hence we propose a multi task loss function, which discovers the relevant anchor point, without needing the ground truth for it. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by experimenting on CambridgeLandmarks (large scale outdoor scenes) as well as 7 Scenes (indoor scenes) using variousCNN feature extractors.

Moreover, the system should also balance the discrimination score ABX, the bit-rate compression rate, and the naturalness and the intelligibility of the constructed voice. To tackle these problems and achieve the best trade-off, we utilize a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and a multi-scale codebook-to-spectrogram (Code2Spec) inverter trained by mean square error and adversarial loss. The VQ-VAE extracts the speech to a latent space, forces itself to map it into the nearest codebook and produces compressed representation. Next, the inverter generates a magnitude spectrogram to the target voice, given the codebook vectors from VQ-VAE. In our experiments, we also investigated several other clustering algorithms, including K-Means and GMM, and compared them with the VQ-VAE result on ABX scores and bit rates.

Recent research usually suggests retraining a model from scratch with remaining training data or refining the model by reverting the model optimization on the marked data points. Unfortunately, aside from their computational inefficiency, those approaches inevitably hurt the resulting model's generalization ability since they remove not only unique characteristics but also discard shared (and possibly contributive) information. To address the performance degradation problem, this paper presents a novel approach called Performance Unchanged Model Augmentation~(PUMA). The proposed PUMA framework explicitly models the influence of each training data point on the model's generalization ability with respect to various performance criteria. It then complements the negative impact of removing marked data by reweighting the remaining data optimally. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PUMA framework, we compared it with multiple state-of-the-art data removal techniques in the experiments, where we show the PUMA can effectively and efficiently remove the unique characteristics of marked training data without retraining the model that can 1) fool a membership attack, and 2) resist performance degradation. In addition, as PUMA estimates the data importance during its operation, we show it could serve to debug mislabelled data points more efficiently than existing approaches."

More precisely, we develop a model-based autoencoder in which the encoder network predicts suitable parameters and the decoder is fixed to a physically meaningful model function, such that we can train the encoding network in an unsupervised way. We illustrate numerically that the resulting network is more than 140 times faster than classical optimization techniques while making predictions with only slightly higher objective values. Using such predictions as starting points of local optimization techniques allows us to converge to better local minima about twice as fast as optimization without the network-based initialization."

Furthermore, we explicitly demonstrate the importance of combining the right dictionary of kernels, which is problematic for methods based on a finite set of base kernels chosen a priori. Our method is not the first approach to work with continuously parameterized kernels. However, we show that our method requires substantially less computation than previous such approaches, and so is more amenable to multiple dimensional parameterizations of base kernels, which we demonstrate."

Specifically, such activity is often performed by tools that react to events or run at specific times. We refer to such automation tools as bots and, in many software mining scenarios related to developer productivity or code quality it is desirable to identify bots in order to separate their actions from actions of individuals. Aim: Find an automated way of identifying bots and code committed by these bots, and to characterize the types of bots based on their activity patterns. Method and Result: We propose BIMAN, a systematic approach to detect bots using author names, commit messages, files modified by the commit, and projects associated with the ommits. For our test data, the value for AUC-ROC was 0.9. We also characterized these bots based on the time patterns of their code commits and the types of files modified, and found that they primarily work with documentation files and web pages, and these files are most prevalent in HTML and JavaScript ecosystems. We have compiled a shareable dataset containing detailed information about 461 bots we found (all of whom have more than 1000 commits) and 13,762,430 commits they created."

        "abstract_text": "Accountability, a requisite for responsible AI, can be facilitated through transparency mechanisms such as audits and explainability. However, prior work suggests that the success of these mechanisms may be limited to Global North contexts; understanding the limitations of current interventions in varied socio-political conditions is crucial to help policymakers facilitate wider accountability. To do so, we examined the mediation of accountability in the existing interactions between vulnerable users and a 'high-risk' AI system in a Global South setting. We report on a qualitative study with 29 financially-stressed users of instant loan platforms in India. We found that users experienced intense feelings of indebtedness for the 'boon' of instant loans, and perceived huge obligations towards loan platforms. Users fulfilled obligations by accepting harsh terms and conditions, over-sharing sensitive data, and paying high fees to unknown and unverified lenders. Users demonstrated a dependence on loan platforms by persisting with such behaviors despite risks of harms such as abuse, recurring debts, discrimination, privacy harms, and self-harm to them. Instead of being enraged with loan platforms, users assumed responsibility for their negative experiences, thus releasing the high-powered loan platforms from accountability obligations. We argue that accountability is shaped by platform-user power relations, and urge caution to policymakers in adopting a purely technical approach to fostering algorithmic accountability. Instead, we call for situated interventions that enhance agency of users, enable meaningful transparency, reconfigure designer-user relations, and prompt a critical reflection in practitioners towards wider accountability. We conclude with implications for responsibly deploying AI in FinTech applications in India and beyond."

Nowadays, enhancement on medical diagnosis via machine learning models has been highly effective in many aspects of e-health analytics. Nevertheless, in the classic cloud-based/centralized e-health paradigms, all the data will be centrally stored on the server to facilitate model training, which inevitably incurs privacy concerns and high time delay. Distributed solutions like Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) are proposed to provide safe and timely diagnostic results based on personal devices. However, methods like D-SGD are subject to the gradient vanishing issue and usually proceed slowly at the early training stage, thereby impeding the effectiveness and efficiency of training. In addition, existing methods are prone to learning models that are biased towards users with dense data, compromising the fairness when providing E-health analytics for minority groups. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Block Coordinate Descent (D-BCD) learning framework that can better optimize deep neural network-based models distributed on decentralized devices for E-health analytics. Benchmarking experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed D-BCD, where additional simulation study showcases the strong applicability of D-BCD in real-life E-health scenarios."

It is done in real time by applying a fully convolutional neural network trained on both simulated and real data. The real data has been labelled by our novel technique which automatically generates ground truth labels for real point clouds. Along with real time workpiece segmentation, our framework also helps in improving the number of detected workpieces and estimating the correct object poses. Moreover, it decreases the computation time by approximately 1s due to a reduction of the search space for the object pose estimation."

This new family, denoted Soft-SVM, allows us to prescribe a generalized linear model that effectively bridges between logistic regression and SVM classification. This new model is interpretable and avoids data separability issues, attaining good fitting and predictive performance by automatically adjusting for data label separability via the softness parameter. These results are confirmed empirically through simulations and case studies as we compare regularized logistic, SVM, and Soft-SVM regressions and conclude that the proposed model performs well in terms of both classification and prediction errors."

In the computational examples, the meta-learned losses are employed at test time for addressing regression and PDE task distributions. Our results indicate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by using a shared-among-tasks offline-learned loss function even for out-of-distribution meta-testing.

While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \\textit{smooth} low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced. In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a \\textit{strict complementarity} condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, approximated variants of two popular \\textit{mirror-prox} methods: the Euclidean \\textit{extragradient method} and mirror-prox with \\textit{matrix exponentiated gradient updates}, when initialized with a \"warm-start\", converge to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$, while requiring only two \\textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration. Moreover, for the extragradient method we also consider relaxed versions of strict complementarity which yield a trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating both the plausibility of the strict complementarity assumption, and the efficient convergence of our proposed low-rank mirror-prox variants."

One problem with conventional clustering is that it does not take the final use of the clustered data into account, which may lead to a very suboptimal use of energy or computational resources. When clustered data are used by a decision-making entity, it turns out that significant gains can be obtained by tailoring the clustering scheme to the final task performed by the decision-making entity. The key to having good final performance is to automatically extract the important attributes of the data space that are inherently relevant to the subsequent decision-making entity, and partition the data space based on these attributes instead of partitioning the data space based on predefined conventional metrics. For this purpose, we formulate the framework of decision-making oriented clustering and propose an algorithm providing a decision-based partition of the data space and good representative decisions. By applying this novel framework and algorithm to a typical problem of real-time pricing and that of power consumption scheduling, we obtain several insightful analytical results such as the expression of the best representative price profiles for real-time pricing and a very significant reduction in terms of required clusters to perform power consumption scheduling as shown by our simulations."

However, these algorithms have faced great challenges when deployed in safety-critical environments since they often exhibit erroneous behaviors that can lead to potentially critical errors. One way to assess the safety of DRL agents is to test them to detect possible faults leading to critical failures during their execution. This raises the question of how we can efficiently test DRL policies to ensure their correctness and adherence to safety requirements. Most existing works on testing DRL agents use adversarial attacks that perturb states or actions of the agent. However, such attacks often lead to unrealistic states of the environment. Their main goal is to test the robustness of DRL agents rather than testing the compliance of agents' policies with respect to requirements. Due to the huge state space of DRL environments, the high cost of test execution, and the black-box nature of DRL algorithms, the exhaustive testing of DRL agents is impossible. In this paper, we propose a Search-based Testing Approach of Reinforcement Learning Agents (STARLA) to test the policy of a DRL agent by effectively searching for failing executions of the agent within a limited testing budget.

In this approach, an ILP system (the learner) decomposes the learning problem into three separate stages: generate, test, and constrain. In the generate stage, the learner generates a hypothesis (a logic program) that satisfies a set of hypothesis constraints (constraints on the syntactic form of hypotheses). In the test stage, the learner tests the hypothesis against training examples. A hypothesis fails when it does not entail all the positive examples or entails a negative example. If a hypothesis fails, then, in the constrain stage, the learner learns constraints from the failed hypothesis to prune the hypothesis space, i.e. to constrain subsequent hypothesis generation. For instance, if a hypothesis is too general (entails a negative example), the constraints prune generalisations of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is too specific (does not entail all the positive examples), the constraints prune specialisations of the hypothesis. This loop repeats until either (i) the learner finds a hypothesis that entails all the positive and none of the negative examples, or (ii) there are no more hypotheses to test.

Going a step further, we propose similarly imposing a budget on the initial dense training phase and show that the resulting simple and efficient method is capable of outperforming significantly more complex or heavily parameterized state-of-the-art approaches that attempt to sparsify the network during training. These findings not only advance our understanding of the retraining phase, but more broadly question the belief that one should aim to avoid the need for retraining and reduce the negative effects of 'hard' pruning by incorporating the sparsification process into the standard training."

We refer to the new method as the rapidly adapting moment estimation (RAME). The theoretical convergence of deterministic RAME is studied by using an analysis similar to the one used in [1] for Adam. Experimental results for training a number of DNNs show promising performance of RAME w.r.t. the convergence speed and generalization performance compared to the stochastic heavy-ball (SHB) method, Adam, and RMSprop."

        "abstract_text": "Various neural network models have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Existing learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness, i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap."

However, an imbalance of sensitivity and specificity measures affected the performance of existing models. This study proposes a method using deep convolutional neural networks aiming to detect melanoma as a binary classification problem. It involves 3 key features, namely customized batch logic, customized loss function and reformed fully connected layers. The training dataset is kept up to date including 17,302 images of melanoma and nevus; this is the largest dataset by far. The model performance is compared to that of 157 dermatologists from 12 university hospitals in Germany based on MClass-D dataset. The model outperformed all 157 dermatologists and achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUC at 94.4% with sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 95.0% using a prediction threshold of 0.5 on the MClass-D dataset of 100 dermoscopic images.

We pose the problem of computing normal vectors to the inlier subspace as a non-convex $\\ell_1$ minimization problem on the sphere, which we call Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) problem. We provide theoretical guarantees under which every global solution to DPCP is a vector in the orthogonal complement of the inlier subspace. Moreover, we relax the non-convex DPCP problem to a recursion of linear programs whose solutions are shown to converge in a finite number of steps to a vector orthogonal to the subspace. In particular, when the inlier subspace is a hyperplane, the solutions to the recursion of linear programs converge to the global minimum of the non-convex DPCP problem in a finite number of steps. We also propose algorithms based on alternating minimization and iteratively re-weighted least squares, which are suitable for dealing with large-scale data."

A promising approach for KBC is to embed knowledge into latent spaces and make predictions from learned embeddings. However, existing embedding models are subject to at least one of the following limitations: (1) theoretical inexpressivity, (2) lack of support for prominent inference patterns (e.g., hierarchies), (3) lack of support for KBC over higher-arity relations, and (4) lack of support for incorporating logical rules. Here, we propose a spatio-translational embedding model, called BoxE, that simultaneously addresses all these limitations. BoxE embeds entities as points, and relations as a set of hyper-rectangles (or boxes), which spatially characterize basic logical properties. This seemingly simple abstraction yields a fully expressive model offering a natural encoding for many desired logical properties. BoxE can both capture and inject rules from rich classes of rule languages, going well beyond individual inference patterns. By design, BoxE naturally applies to higher-arity KBs. We conduct a detailed experimental analysis, and show that BoxE achieves state-of-the-art performance, both on benchmark knowledge graphs and on more general KBs, and we empirically show the power of integrating logical rules."

As ML techniques are becoming a popular solution for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) applications in research literatures, the security of these applications is of concern. However, current studies on adversarial machine learning (AML) mainly focus on pure cyberspace domains. The risks the adversarial examples can bring to the CPS applications have not been well investigated. In particular, due to the distributed property of data sources and the inherent physical constraints imposed by CPSs, the widely-used threat models and the state-of-the-art AML algorithms in previous cyberspace research become infeasible. We study the potential vulnerabilities of ML applied in CPSs by proposing Constrained Adversarial Machine Learning (ConAML), which generates adversarial examples that satisfy the intrinsic constraints of the physical systems. We first summarize the difference between AML in CPSs and AML in existing cyberspace systems and propose a general threat model for ConAML. We then design a best-effort search algorithm to iteratively generate adversarial examples with linear physical constraints. We evaluate our algorithms with simulations of two typical CPSs, the power grids and the water treatment system. The results show that our ConAML algorithms can effectively generate adversarial examples which significantly decrease the performance of the ML models even under practical constraints."

This requires approaches to effectively detect and resolve disturbances to ensure optimal operations. While the control system can compensate for many types of disturbances, there are changes to the process which it still cannot handle adequately. It is therefore important to further develop monitoring systems to effectively detect and identify those faults such that they can be quickly resolved by operators. In this paper, a novel probabilistic fault detection and identification method is proposed which adopts a newly developed deep learning approach using Bayesian recurrent neural networks~(BRNNs) with variational dropout. The BRNN model is general and can model complex nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, compared to traditional statistic-based data-driven fault detection and identification methods, the proposed BRNN-based method yields uncertainty estimates which allow for simultaneous fault detection of chemical processes, direct fault identification, and fault propagation analysis. The outstanding performance of this method is demonstrated and contrasted to (dynamic) principal component analysis, which are widely applied in the industry, in the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process~(TEP) and a real chemical manufacturing dataset."

Removing sensitive attributes of data does not solve this problem because a \\textit{disparate impact} can arise when non-sensitive attributes and sensitive attributes are correlated. Here, we study a fair machine learning algorithm that avoids such a disparate impact when making a decision. Inspired by the two-stage least squares method that is widely used in the field of economics, we propose a two-stage algorithm that removes bias in the training data. The proposed algorithm is conceptually simple. Unlike most of existing fair algorithms that are designed for classification tasks, the proposed method is able to (i) deal with regression tasks, (ii) combine explanatory attributes to remove reverse discrimination, and (iii) deal with numerical sensitive attributes. The performance and fairness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in simulations with synthetic and real-world datasets."

Conventional k-fold Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) procedure uses a pseudo-random sequence to partition instances into k subsets, which usually causes subsampling bias, inflates generalization errors and jeopardizes the reliability and effectiveness of cross-validation. Based on ordered systematic sampling theory in statistics and low-discrepancy sequence theory in number theory, we propose a new k-fold cross-validation procedure by replacing a pseudo-random sequence with a best-discrepancy sequence, which ensures low subsampling bias and leads to more precise Expected-Prediction-Error estimates. Experiments with 156 benchmark datasets and three classifiers (logistic regression, decision tree and naive bayes) show that in general, our cross-validation procedure can extrude subsampling bias in the MCCV by lowering the EPE around 7.18% and the variances around 26.73%. In comparison, the stratified MCCV can reduce the EPE and variances of the MCCV around 1.58% and 11.85% respectively. The Leave-One-Out (LOO) can lower the EPE around 2.50% but its variances are much higher than the any other CV procedure. The computational time of our cross-validation procedure is just 8.64% of the MCCV, 8.67% of the stratified MCCV and 16.72% of the LOO. Experiments also show that our approach is more beneficial for datasets characterized by relatively small size and large aspect ratio. This makes our approach particularly pertinent when solving bioscience classification problems. Our proposed systematic subsampling technique could be generalized to other machine learning algorithms that involve random subsampling mechanism."

Interesting outliers are often found by accident, but this will become increasingly more difficult with future big surveys generating an enormous amount of data. This gives the need for machine learning detection techniques to find the interesting weird objects. In this work, we inspect the galaxy spectra of the third data release of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey and look for the weird outlying galaxies using two different outlier detection techniques. First, we apply distance-based Unsupervised Random Forest on the galaxy spectra using the flux values as input features. Spectra with a high outlier score are inspected and divided into different categories such as blends, quasi-stellar objects, and BPT outliers. We also experiment with a reconstruction-based outlier detection method using a variational autoencoder and compare the results of the two different methods. At last, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques on the output of the methods to inspect the clustering of similar spectra. We find that both unsupervised methods extract important features from the data and can be used to find many different types of outliers."

In the iterations of ADMM, model updates using local private data and model exchanges among agents impose critical privacy concerns. Despite some pioneering works to relieve such concerns, differentially private ADMM still confronts many research challenges. For example, the guarantee of differential privacy (DP) relies on the premise that the optimality of each local problem can be perfectly attained in each ADMM iteration, which may never happen in practice. The model trained by DP ADMM may have low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we address these concerns by proposing a novel (Improved) Plausible differentially Private ADMM algorithm, called PP-ADMM and IPP-ADMM. In PP-ADMM, each agent approximately solves a perturbed optimization problem that is formulated from its local private data in an iteration, and then perturbs the approximate solution with Gaussian noise to provide the DP guarantee. To further improve the model accuracy and convergence, an improved version IPP-ADMM adopts sparse vector technique (SVT) to determine if an agent should update its neighbors with the current perturbed solution. The agent calculates the difference of the current solution from that in the last iteration, and if the difference is larger than a threshold, it passes the solution to neighbors; or otherwise the solution will be discarded. Moreover, we propose to track the total privacy loss under the zero-concentrated DP (zCDP) and provide a generalization performance analysis."

However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior findings in the literature, produce better-grounded GNN architectures for edge-centric tasks, and demonstrate empirical results on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark.

This batching task is generally difficult, but it becomes a major hurdle as architectures become complex. In this paper, we present an algorithm, and its implementation in the DyNet toolkit, for automatically batching operations. Developers simply write minibatch computations as aggregations of single instance computations, and the batching algorithm seamlessly executes them, on the fly, using computationally efficient batched operations. On a variety of tasks, we obtain throughput similar to that obtained with manual batches, as well as comparable speedups over single-instance learning on architectures that are impractical to batch manually."

This makes the process of deciphering the sized based variants from each other using computer vision algorithms alone impractical. In this work, we propose methods to ascertain the size variant of the product as a downstream task to an object detector which extracts products from shelf and a classifier which determines product brand. Product variant determination is the task which assigns a product variant to products of a brand based on the size of bounding boxes and brands predicted by classifier.

The key challenge for training energy networks lies in computing loss gradients, as this typically requires argmin/argmax differentiation. In this paper, building upon a generalized notion of conjugate function, which replaces the usual bilinear pairing with a general energy function, we propose generalized Fenchel-Young losses, a natural loss construction for learning energy networks. Our losses enjoy many desirable properties and their gradients can be computed efficiently without argmin/argmax differentiation.

In particular, we study the utility of hybrid model estimators that compute the mean of arbitrary real-valued distributions with bounded support. When the curator knows the distribution's variance, we design a hybrid estimator that, for realistic datasets and parameter settings, achieves a constant factor improvement over natural baselines. We then analytically characterize how the estimator's utility is parameterized by the problem setting and parameter choices. When the distribution's variance is unknown, we design a heuristic hybrid estimator and analyze how it compares to the baselines. We find that it often performs better than the baselines, and sometimes almost as well as the known-variance estimator. We then answer the question of how our estimator's utility is affected when users' data are not drawn from the same distribution, but rather from distributions dependent on their trust model preference. Concretely, we examine the implications of the two groups' distributions diverging and show that in some cases, our estimators maintain fairly high utility. We then demonstrate how our hybrid estimator can be incorporated as a sub-component in more complex, higher-dimensional applications. Finally, we propose a new privacy amplification notion for the hybrid model that emerges due to interaction between the groups, and derive corresponding amplification results for our hybrid estimators."

We focus on disambiguating the role of one of these parameters: the number of negative examples.

Our analysis also shows that the popular deep network components such as residual block, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) do indeed help to achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented with high-pass branches to meet the PR condition.

Although existing approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting problem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a single task in supervised training. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks."

        "abstract_text": "Fabrication process variations can significantly influence the performance and yield of nano-scale electronic and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral methods have achieved great success in quantifying the impact of process variations, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Recently, low-rank tensor methods have been developed to mitigate this issue, but two fundamental challenges remain open: how to automatically determine the tensor rank and how to adaptively pick the informative simulation samples. This paper proposes a novel tensor regression method to address these two challenges. We use a $\\ell_{q}/ \\ell_{2}$ group-sparsity regularization to determine the tensor rank. The resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved via an alternating minimization solver. We also propose a two-stage adaptive sampling method to reduce the simulation cost. Our method considers both exploration and exploitation via the estimated Voronoi cell volume and nonlinearity measurement respectively. The proposed model is verified with synthetic and some realistic circuit benchmarks, on which our method can well capture the uncertainty caused by 19 to 100 random variables with only 100 to 600 simulation samples."

Fitting a model of planetary gaps to these observed features using customized simulations or empirical relations can reveal the characteristics of the hidden planets. However, customized fitting is often impractical owing to the increasing sample size and the complexity of disk-planet interaction. In this paper we introduce the architecture of DPNNet-2.0, second in the series after DPNNet \\citep{aud20}, designed using a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN, here specifically ResNet50) for predicting exoplanet masses directly from simulated images of protoplanetary disks hosting a single planet. DPNNet-2.0 additionally consists of a multi-input framework that uses both a CNN and multi-layer perceptron (a class of artificial neural network) for processing image and disk parameters simultaneously. This enables DPNNet-2.0 to be trained using images directly, with the added option of considering disk parameters (disk viscosities, disk temperatures, disk surface density profiles, dust abundances, and particle Stokes numbers) generated from disk-planet hydrodynamic simulations as inputs. This work provides the required framework and is the first step towards the use of computer vision (implementing CNN) to directly extract mass of an exoplanet from planetary gaps observed in dust-surface density maps by telescopes such as the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array."

The method is essentially an enhanced cross-validation strategy. Although the process uses great computational resources, the resulting performance metrics on resampled fraud data show that increased system cost can be justified. A fundamental key to fraud data is that it is inherently not systematic and, as of yet, the optimal resampling methodology has not been identified. Building a test harness that accounts for all permutations of algorithm sample set pairs demonstrates that the complex, intrinsic data structures are all thoroughly tested. Using a comparative analysis on fraud data that applies stacked generalizations provides useful insight needed to find the optimal mathematical formula to be used for imbalanced fraud data sets."

It is very difficult and time consuming for robot to process using such raw data when the robot tries to construct 3D model. Hence, there needs to be a method that can extract useful information from such sensory inputs. To address this problem our method utilizes the concept of Object Semantic Hierarchy (OSH). Different from the previous work that used this hierarchy framework, we extract the motion information using the Deep Belief Network technique instead of applying classical computer vision approaches. We have trained on two large sets of random dot images (10,000) which are translated and rotated, respectively, and have successfully extracted several bases that explain the translation and rotation motion. Based on this translation and rotation bases, background subtraction have become possible using Object Semantic Hierarchy."

It does not require the target speakers to be experts in expressing all styles and to collect corresponding recordings for model training. However, the performances of existing style transfer methods are still far behind real application needs. The root causes are mainly twofold. Firstly, the style embedding extracted from single reference speech can hardly provide fine-grained and appropriate prosody information for arbitrary text to synthesize. Secondly, in these models the content/text, prosody, and speaker timbre are usually highly entangled, it's therefore not realistic to expect a satisfied result when freely combining these components, such as to transfer speaking style between speakers. In this paper, we propose a cross-speaker style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) model with explicit prosody bottleneck. The prosody bottleneck builds up the kernels accounting for speaking style robustly, and disentangles the prosody from content and speaker timbre, therefore guarantees high quality cross-speaker style transfer. Evaluation result shows the proposed method even achieves on-par performance with source speaker's speaker-dependent (SD) model in objective measurement of prosody, and significantly outperforms the cycle consistency and GMVAE-based baselines in objective and subjective evaluations."

Computer vision foundation models, which are trained on diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer vision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art results in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of 97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600."

Given that the bottom up, inductively constructed, semantic and syntactic structures are brittle, and seemingly incapable of adequately representing the meaning of longer sentences or realistic dialogues, natural language understanding is in need of a new foundation. Coinduction, which uses top down constraints, has been successfully used in the design of operating systems and programming languages. Moreover, implicitly it has been present in text mining, machine translation, and in some attempts to model intensionality and modalities, which provides evidence that it works. This article shows high level formalizations of some of such uses. Since coinduction and induction can coexist, they can provide a common language and a conceptual model for research in natural language understanding. In particular, such an opportunity seems to be emerging in research on compositionality. This article shows several examples of the joint appearance of induction and coinduction in natural language processing. We argue that the known individual limitations of induction and coinduction can be overcome in empirical settings by a combination of the the two methods.

Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the models of choice for this task. Despite their success in time series forecasting, less attention has been paid to make the RNNs trustworthy. For example, RNNs can not naturally provide an uncertainty measure to their predictions. This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g. to detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern in the time series. Whittle Sum-Product Networks (WSPNs), prominent deep tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs) for time series, can assist an RNN with providing meaningful probabilities as uncertainty measure. With this aim, we propose RECOWN, a novel architecture that employs RNNs and a discriminant variant of WSPNs called Conditional WSPNs (CWSPNs). We also formulate a Log-Likelihood Ratio Score as better estimation of uncertainty that is tailored to time series and Whittle likelihoods. In our experiments, we show that RECOWNs are accurate and trustworthy time series predictors, able to \"know when they do not know\"."

This allows us to reduce the problem of sampling non-smooth (constrained) densities in ${\\bf R}^n$ to sampling smooth densities over appropriate manifolds, while needing access only to the gradient of the log-density, and this, in turn, to sampling from the natural Brownian motion on the manifold. Our main analytic tools are (1) an extension of self-concordance to manifolds, and (2) a stochastic approach to bounding smoothness on manifolds. A special case of our approach is sampling isoperimetric densities restricted to polytopes by using the metric defined by the logarithmic barrier."

How to efficiently deploy deep models for diverse deployment scenarios is a new challenge. Previous NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes simultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual superclasses. A straightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each deployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To address this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic Architecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for diverse superclasses with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose to effectively train an over-parameterized network via a superclass dropout strategy during training. In this way, the resulting model is robust to the subsequent superclasses dropping at inference time. Based on the well-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient architecture generator to obtain promising architectures within a single forward pass. Experiments on three image classification datasets show that EAS is able to find more compact networks with better performance while remarkably being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods, e.g., outperforming OFA (once-for-all) by 1.3% on Top-1 accuracy at a budget around 361M #MAdds on ImageNet-10.

This explains why, over the past decade, there have been many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven empiricallthat ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 15 real datasets from the UCI repository prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional RF. Most of our experiments achieved at least 95% or above pruning level while retaining or outperforming the RF accuracy."

In this work, we leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs for graph coarsening. We first propose a framework for measuring the quality of coarsening algorithm and show that depending on the goal, we need to carefully choose the Laplace operator on the coarse graph and associated projection/lift operators. Motivated by the observation that the current choice of edge weight for the coarse graph may be sub-optimal, we parametrize the weight assignment map with graph neural networks and train it to improve the coarsening quality in an unsupervised way. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves common graph coarsening methods under various metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes, and graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size ($25\\times$ of training graphs), is adaptive to different losses (differentiable and non-differentiable), and scales to much larger graphs than previous work."

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm in order to tackle the blind separation of non-negative sparse sources from noisy measurements. We first show that sparsity and non-negativity constraints have to be carefully applied on the sought-after solution. In fact, improperly constrained solutions are unlikely to be stable and are therefore sub-optimal. The proposed algorithm, named nGMCA (non-negative Generalized Morphological Component Analysis), makes use of proximal calculus techniques to provide properly constrained solutions. The performance of nGMCA compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms is demonstrated by numerical experiments encompassing a wide variety of settings, with negligible parameter tuning.

We show that on jointly Gaussian distributions, our method with depth $w$ runs in $O(p^{w+3})$ time. We compare our method with $w = 1$ to algorithms for finding sparse elimination orderings of undirected graphs, and show that taking advantage of DAG-specific problem structure leads to a significant improvement in the discovered permutation. We also compare our algorithm to provably consistent causal structure learning algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, GES, and GSP, and show that our method achieves comparable performance with a shorter runtime. Thus, our method can be used on its own for causal structure discovery. Finally, we show that there exist dense graphs on which our method achieves almost perfect performance, so that unlike most existing causal structure learning algorithms, the situations in which our algorithm achieves both good performance and good runtime are not limited to sparse graphs."

        "abstract_text": "We present a novel dynamic recommendation model that focuses on users who have interactions in the past but turn relatively inactive recently. Making effective recommendations to these time-sensitive cold-start users is critical to maintain the user base of a recommender system. Due to the sparse recent interactions, it is challenging to capture these users' current preferences precisely. Solely relying on their historical interactions may also lead to outdated recommendations misaligned with their recent interests. The proposed model leverages historical and current user-item interactions and dynamically factorizes a user's (latent) preference into time-specific and time-evolving representations that jointly affect user behaviors. These latent factors further interact with an optimized item embedding to achieve accurate and timely recommendations. Experiments over real-world data help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed time-sensitive cold-start recommendation model."

However, for social images which contain both link information and multimodal contents (e.g., text description, and visual content), simply employing the embedding learnt from network structure or data content results in sub-optimal social image representation. In this paper, we propose a novel social image embedding approach called Deep Multimodal Attention Networks (DMAN), which employs a deep model to jointly embed multimodal contents and link information. Specifically, to effectively capture the correlations between multimodal contents, we propose a multimodal attention network to encode the fine-granularity relation between image regions and textual words. To leverage the network structure for embedding learning, a novel Siamese-Triplet neural network is proposed to model the links among images. With the joint deep model, the learnt embedding can capture both the multimodal contents and the nonlinear network information. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of our approach in the applications of multi-label classification and cross-modal search. Compared to state-of-the-art image embeddings, our proposed DMAN achieves significant improvement in the tasks of multi-label classification and cross-modal search."

Standard CNNs cannot learn the distribution of DCT coefficients because the convolution throws away the spatial coordinates, which are essential for DCT coefficients. We illustrate how to design and train a neural network that can learn the distribution of DCT coefficients. Furthermore, we introduce Compression Artifact Tracing Network (CAT-Net) that jointly uses image acquisition artifacts and compression artifacts. It significantly outperforms traditional and deep neural network-based methods in detecting and localizing tampered regions."

We define two small languages that support decision-making abstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with probabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics. In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics, with varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and expected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of standard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution strategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional, rely on the selection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle other effects, such as rewards or probability. We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases. We also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of observation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of correlation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and probability, establishing completeness at base types for the case of rewards without probability."

We then employ an RL agent to learn to draw inductors that meet certain target specifications. In light of the need to tweak the target specifications throughout the circuit design cycle, we also develop a variant in which the agent can learn to quickly adapt to draw new inductors for moderately different target specifications.

We examine approximate inference in variational autoencoders in terms of these factors. We find that divergence from the true posterior is often due to imperfect recognition networks, rather than the limited complexity of the approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation."

Previously, an aggregation-based certified defense, Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), was proposed to mitigate this threat. DPA predicts through an aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data, thus restricting its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, we propose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks, namely Finite Aggregation. In contrast to DPA, which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, our method first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates of them to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers. This reduces the worst-case impacts of poison samples and thus improves certified robustness bounds. In addition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging the designs of deterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses. Empirically, our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87% and 4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPA's, effectively establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certified robustness against data poisoning."

However, to achieve high-performance level DL models require numerous labeled training samples ($n$) rarely available in many fields. This paper presents a pre-training method involving graph convolutional/neural networks (GCNs/GNNs), based on maximizing mutual information between two high-level embeddings of an input sample. Many of the recently proposed pre-training methods pre-train one of many possible networks of an architecture. Since almost every DL model is an ensemble of multiple networks, we take our high-level embeddings from two different networks of a model --a convolutional and a graph network--. The learned high-level graph latent representations help increase performance for downstream graph classification tasks and bypass the need for a high number of labeled data samples. We apply our method to a neuroimaging dataset for classifying subjects into healthy control (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) groups.

Thus, recent works focused on learning low-dimensional representations that may reduce the need for data. This paper presents a new and efficient method for learning such representations. Salient segments of consecutive frames are detected from their optical flow, and clustered based on their feature descriptors. The clusters typically correspond to different discovered categories of objects. Segments detected in new frames are then classified based on their nearest clusters. Because only a few categories are relevant to a given task, the importance of a category is defined as the correlation between its occurrence and the agent's performance. The result is encoded as a vector indicating objects that are in the frame and their locations, and used as a side input to DRQN.

Numerical solution procedures for many dynamical systems have existed for several decades, but can be slow due to high-dimensional state space of the dynamical system. Thus, deep learning-based reduced order models (ROMs) are of interest and one such family of algorithms along these lines are based on the Koopman theory. This paper extends a recently developed adversarial Koopman model (Balakrishnan \\& Upadhyay, arXiv:2006.05547) to stochastic space, where the Koopman operator applies on the probability distribution of the latent encoding of an encoder. Specifically, the latent encoding of the system is modeled as a Gaussian, and is advanced in time by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs two Koopman matrices $K_{\\mu}$ and $K_{\\sigma}$. Adversarial and gradient losses are used and this is found to lower the prediction errors. A reduced Koopman formulation is also undertaken where the Koopman matrices are assumed to have a tridiagonal structure, and this yields predictions comparable to the baseline model with full Koopman matrices. The efficacy of the stochastic Koopman model is demonstrated on different test problems in chaos, fluid dynamics, combustion, and reaction-diffusion models. The proposed model is also applied in a setting where the Koopman matrices are conditioned on other input parameters for generalization and this is applied to simulate the state of a Lithium-ion battery in time.

In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover, the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more scalable with the data and variables.

Nevertheless, the coarse resolution may lead to difficulties in medical diagnosis by either physicians or computer-aided diagnosis algorithms. Deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution (SR) methods are feasible ways to improve resolution, with convolutional neural networks (CNN) at their core. Despite recent progress, these methods are limited by inherent properties of convolution operators, which ignore content relevance and cannot effectively model long-range dependencies. In addition, most of the existing methods use pseudo-paired volumes for training and evaluation, where pseudo low-resolution (LR) volumes are generated by a simple degradation of their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the domain gap between pseudo- and real-LR volumes leads to the poor performance of these methods in practice. In this paper, we build the first public real-paired dataset RPLHR-CT as a benchmark for volumetric SR, and provide baseline results by re-implementing four state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. Considering the inherent shortcoming of CNN, we also propose a transformer volumetric super-resolution network (TVSRN) based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with convolutions entirely. This is the first research to use a pure transformer for CT volumetric SR. The experimental results show that TVSRN significantly outperforms all baselines on both PSNR and SSIM.

In this work, we propose GRAPHITE, an efficient and general framework for generating attacks that satisfy the above three key requirements. GRAPHITE takes advantage of transform-robustness, a metric based on expectation over transforms (EoT), to automatically generate small masks and optimize with gradient-free optimization. GRAPHITE is also flexible as it can easily trade-off transform-robustness, perturbation size, and query count in black-box settings. On a GTSRB model in a hard-label black-box setting, we are able to find attacks on all possible 1,806 victim-target class pairs with averages of 77.8% transform-robustness, perturbation size of 16.63% of the victim images, and 126K queries per pair.

        "abstract_text": "Tensor network methods have been a key ingredient of advances in condensed matter physics and have recently sparked interest in the machine learning community for their ability to compactly represent very high-dimensional objects. Tensor network methods can for example be used to efficiently learn linear models in exponentially large feature spaces [Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016]. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the VC dimension and pseudo-dimension of a large class of tensor network models for classification, regression and completion. Our upper bounds hold for linear models parameterized by arbitrary tensor network structures, and we derive lower bounds for common tensor decomposition models~(CP, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring and Tucker) showing the tightness of our general upper bound. These results are used to derive a generalization bound which can be applied to classification with low rank matrices as well as linear classifiers based on any of the commonly used tensor decomposition models. As a corollary of our results, we obtain a bound on the VC dimension of the matrix product state classifier introduced in [Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016] as a function of the so-called bond dimension~(i.e. tensor train rank), which answers an open problem listed by Cirac, Garre-Rubio and P\\'erez-Garc\\'ia in [Cirac et al., 2019]."

        "abstract_text": "Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but label-scarce target domain. The conventional DA strategy is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. Recently, increasing researches have focused on self-training or other semi-supervised algorithms to explore the data structure of the target domain. However, the bulk of them depend largely on confident samples in order to build reliable pseudo labels, prototypes or cluster centers. Representing the target data structure in such a way would overlook the huge low-confidence samples, resulting in sub-optimal transferability that is biased towards the samples similar to the source domain. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning method by processing low-confidence samples, which encourages the model to make use of the target data structure through the instance discrimination process. To be specific, we create positive and negative pairs only using low-confidence samples, and then re-represent the original features with the classifier weights rather than directly utilizing them, which can better encode the task-specific semantic information. Furthermore, we combine cross-domain mixup to augment the proposed contrastive loss. Consequently, the domain gap can be well bridged through contrastive learning of intermediate representations across domains. We evaluate the proposed method in both unsupervised and semi-supervised DA settings, and extensive experimental results on benchmarks reveal that our method is effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We take advantage of this method to learn better natural language representation, and employ it on text classification and text clustering tasks. Through disentanglement, we obtain text representations with better-defined clusters and improve text classification performance.

Once the model has learned how to inpaint healthy tissue, we test its performance on images with and without abnormalities. We discuss and motivate our results considering PSNR, MSE and SSIM scores as evaluation metrics. In addition, we conduct a 2AFC observer study showing that in half of the times an expert is unable to distinguish real images from the ones reconstructed using our model.

We combine the proposed mention anomaly score with a recently proposed change-point detection technique based on the Sequentially Discounting Normalized Maximum Likelihood (SDNML), or with Kleinberg's burst model.

Yet the majority of CNNs are unable to satisfy the strict requirement for real-world deployment. To overcome this, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the redundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their \"importance\" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter could be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary according to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial view of the comprehensive \"importance\". From this motivation, we propose a novel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring the criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria Clustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning criteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of \"importance\" score. Second, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their significance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal blending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm. Quantitative results on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, regrading to the compact model performance after pruning."

To this end, this paper proposes a universal learning scheme to get a further 3\\% performance improvement for all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The major highlight of our method is that we resort the \"motion quality\"---a brand new concept, to select a sub-group of video frames from the original testing set to construct a new training set. The selected frames in this new training set should all contain high-quality motions, in which the salient objects will have large probability to be successfully detected by the \"target SOTA method\"---the one we want to improve. Consequently, we can achieve a significant performance improvement by using this new training set to start a new round of network training. During this new round training, the VSOD results of the target SOTA method will be applied as the pseudo training objectives. Our novel learning scheme is simple yet effective, and its semi-supervised methodology may have large potential to inspire the VSOD community in the future."

Previously, an incremental discovery approach has been introduced where a model, considered to be under construction, gets incrementally extended by user-selected process behavior. This paper introduces a novel approach that additionally allows the user to freeze model parts within the model under construction.

Concretely, our goal is to design a data-driven filtering system with a minimal run-time cost for determining which data event to keep, while preserving (and potentially improving upon) the distribution of the output as generated by the hand-designed trigger system.

This paper presents a new federated learning scheme that provides different trade-offs between robustness, privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and model accuracy. Our scheme uses biased quantization of model updates and hence is bandwidth efficient. It is also robust against state-of-the-art backdoor as well as model degradation attacks even when a large proportion of the participant nodes are malicious. We propose a practical differentially private extension of this scheme which protects the whole dataset of participating entities. We show that this extension performs as efficiently as the non-private but robust scheme, even with stringent privacy requirements but are less robust against model degradation and backdoor attacks.

To address the lack of data, we exploit two key characteristics for the loads and DERs, namely the sparse changes due to infrequent activities of appliances and electric vehicles (EVs) and the locational dependence of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation. Accordingly, meaningful regularization terms are introduced to cast a convex load recovery problem, which will be further simplified to reduce the computational complexity. The load recovery solutions can be utilized to identify the EV charging events at each load node and to infer the total behind-the-meter PV output. Numerical tests using real-world data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing the visibility of grid-edge DERs."

The requirement of large training samples results in erasing the individual/minor patterns in feature extraction; 3). The hyperparameters are required to be tuned manually, which is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a novel deep nonlinear matrix factorization named Deep Matrix Approximately Nonlinear Decomposition (DEMAND) in this work to take advantage of the shallow linear model, e.g., Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL) and DNNs. At first, the proposed DEMAND employs a non-fully connected and multilayer-stacked architecture that is easier to be optimized compared with canonical DNNs; furthermore, due to the efficient architecture, training DEMAND can avoid overfitting and enables the recognition of individual/minor features based on a small dataset such as an individual data; finally, a novel rank estimator technique is introduced to tune all hyperparameters of DEMAND automatically. Moreover, the proposed DEMAND is validated by four other peer methodologies via real functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data in the human brain.

In this direction, we first introduce a general formulation of probabilistic specifications for neural networks, which captures both probabilistic networks (e.g., Bayesian neural networks, MC-Dropout networks) and uncertain inputs (distributions over inputs arising from sensor noise or other perturbations). We then propose a general technique to verify such specifications by generalizing the notion of Lagrangian duality, replacing standard Lagrangian multipliers with \"functional multipliers\" that can be arbitrary functions of the activations at a given layer. We show that an optimal choice of functional multipliers leads to exact verification (i.e., sound and complete verification), and for specific forms of multipliers, we develop tractable practical verification algorithms. We empirically validate our algorithms by applying them to Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and MC Dropout Networks, and certifying properties such as adversarial robustness and robust detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. On these tasks we are able to provide significantly stronger guarantees when compared to prior work -- for instance, for a VGG-64 MC-Dropout CNN trained on CIFAR-10, we improve the certified AUC (a verified lower bound on the true AUC) for robust OOD detection (on CIFAR-100) from $0\\% \\rightarrow 29\\%$.

Using this topology, a state-independent hierarchical policy can select where the agent has to keep discovering skills in the state space. In turn, the newly visited states allows an improved learnt representation and the learning loop continues. Our experiments emphasize that DisTop is agnostic to the ground state representation and that the agent can discover the topology of its environment whether the states are high-dimensional binary data, images, or proprioceptive inputs. We demonstrate that this paradigm is competitiveon MuJoCo benchmarks with state-of-the-art algorithms on both single-task dense rewards and diverse skill discovery. By combining these two aspects, we showthat DisTop achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) when rewards are sparse.

In this paper, we propose a framework to identify information-leaking features via information density estimation. Here, features whose information densities exceed a pre-defined threshold are deemed information-leaking features. Once these features are identified, we sequentially pass them through a targeted obfuscation mechanism with a provable leakage guarantee in terms of $\\mathsf{E}_\\gamma$-divergence. The core of this mechanism relies on a data-driven estimate of the trimmed information density for which we propose a novel estimator, named the trimmed information density estimator (TIDE). We then use TIDE to implement our mechanism on three real-world datasets. Our approach can be used as a data-driven pipeline for designing obfuscation mechanisms targeting specific features."

We present a novel method for designing neural network topologies that directly map to a highly efficient FPGA implementation. By exploiting the equivalence of artificial neurons with quantized inputs/outputs and truth tables, we can train quantized neural networks that can be directly converted to a netlist of truth tables, and subsequently deployed as a highly pipelinable, massively parallel FPGA circuit. However, the neural network topology requires careful consideration since the hardware cost of truth tables grows exponentially with neuron fan-in. To obtain smaller networks where the whole netlist can be placed-and-routed onto a single FPGA, we derive a fan-in driven hardware cost model to guide topology design, and combine high sparsity with low-bit activation quantization to limit the neuron fan-in. We evaluate our approach on two tasks with very high intrinsic throughput requirements in high-energy physics and network intrusion detection. We show that the combination of sparsity and low-bit activation quantization results in high-speed circuits with small logic depth and low LUT cost, demonstrating competitive accuracy with less than 15 ns of inference latency and throughput in the hundreds of millions of inferences per second."

To solve such chicken-egg problem, we propose COLAM framework that Co-Learns DNNs and soft labels through Alternating Minimization of two objectives - (a) the training loss subject to soft labels and (b) the objective to learn improved soft labels - in one end-to-end training procedure.

The proposed method does not require the exact model of the system to be controlled, and it is robust against variations in system dynamics as well as operational uncertainties. The learning is divided into two phases: offline (pre-)training and online (post-)training. In the former, a conventional controller performs a set of trajectories and, based on the input-output dataset, the deep neural network (DNN)-based controller is trained. In the latter, the trained DNN, which mimics the conventional controller, controls the system. Unlike the existing papers in the literature, the network is still being trained for different sets of trajectories which are not used in the training phase of DNN. Thanks to the rule-base, which contains the expert knowledge, the proposed framework learns the system dynamics and operational uncertainties in real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed online learning-based approach gives better trajectory tracking performance when compared to the only offline trained network."

GNNs are particularly promising here as they learn a molecular graph-to-property relationship without pretraining, typically required for transformers, and are, unlike MCMs, applicable to molecules not included in training. For ILs, however, GNN applications are currently missing. Herein, we present a GNN to predict temperature-dependent infinite dilution ACs of solutes in ILs. We train the GNN on a database including more than 40,000 AC values and compare it to a state-of-the-art MCM.

There can be a challenge in tying together such two targets when the distribution of function observations scales to high-dimensional and noisy spaces. Instead, noise contrastive estimation might be able to provide more robust representations by learning distributional matching objectives to combat such inherent limitation of generative models. In light of this, we propose to equip CNPs by 1) aligning prediction with encoded ground-truth observation, and 2) decoupling meta-representation adaptation from generative reconstruction. Specifically, two auxiliary contrastive branches are set up hierarchically, namely in-instantiation temporal contrastive learning~({\\tt TCL}) and cross-instantiation function contrastive learning~({\\tt FCL}), to facilitate local predictive alignment and global function consistency, respectively. We empirically show that {\\tt TCL} captures high-level abstraction of observations, whereas {\\tt FCL} helps identify underlying functions, which in turn provides more efficient representations.

This is particularly challenging when estimating CMI. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, based on k nearest neighbors (k-NN), to perform the resampling and derive high-confidence concentration bounds for the sample average. Then the technique is employed to train a neural network classifier and the CMI is estimated accordingly.

In this work, we advance the understanding of the relations between the network's architecture and its generalizability from the compression perspective. Using tensor analysis, we propose a series of intuitive, data-dependent and easily-measurable properties that tightly characterize the compressibility and generalizability of neural networks; thus, in practice, our generalization bound outperforms the previous compression-based ones, especially for neural networks using tensors as their weight kernels (e.g. CNNs). Moreover, these intuitive measurements provide further insights into designing neural network architectures with properties favorable for better/guaranteed generalizability. Our experimental results demonstrate that through the proposed measurable properties, our generalization error bound matches the trend of the test error well. Our theoretical analysis further provides justifications for the empirical success and limitations of some widely-used tensor-based compression approaches.

We give two distributed optimization methods for computing the decomposition, which find the optimal decomposition when the component class loss functions are convex, and are good heuristics when they are not. Both methods require only the masked proximal operator of each of the component loss functions, a generalization of the well-known proximal operator that handles missing entries in its argument.

In order to better understand how reasonable these approximation strategies are, we need to know the computational complexity of measuring the quality of approximation. In this article, we will prove some computational results related to the problem of extracting Finite State Machine (FSM) based models from trained RNN Language models.

This high dimensionality makes it difficult to analyze the reservoir computer using tools from dynamical systems theory. Additionally, the need to create and connect large numbers of nonlinear nodes makes it difficult to design and build analog reservoir computers that can be faster and consume less power than digital reservoir computers. We demonstrate here that a reservoir computer may be divided into two parts; a small set of nonlinear nodes (the reservoir), and a separate set of time-shifted reservoir output signals. The time-shifted output signals serve to increase the rank and memory of the reservoir computer, and the set of nonlinear nodes may create an embedding of the input dynamical system. We use this time-shifting technique to obtain excellent performance from an opto-electronic delay-based reservoir computer with only a small number of virtual nodes. Because only a few nonlinear nodes are required, construction of a reservoir computer becomes much easier, and delay-based reservoir computers can operate at much higher speeds."

Use of deep neural networks as inverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imaging including CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been demonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers, one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the measurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this paper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks. Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max formulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which suppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using the proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In addition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep networks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed approach over other methods.

Saec also adopts a fast clustering optimization based on feature frequency to drastically improve clustering time. We implement and evaluate Saec on Numerous, the production distributed machine learning system in Tencent, with 10-day worth of feature data from QQ mobile browser.

A popular formulation of the problem is an $\\ell_1$ regularized maximum likelihood estimation. Many convex optimization algorithms have been designed to solve this formulation to recover the graph structure. Recently, there is a surge of interest to learn algorithms directly based on data, and in this case, learn to map empirical covariance to the sparse precision matrix. However, it is a challenging task in this case, since the symmetric positive definiteness (SPD) and sparsity of the matrix are not easy to enforce in learned algorithms, and a direct mapping from data to precision matrix may contain many parameters. We propose a deep learning architecture, GLAD, which uses an Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm as our model inductive bias, and learns the model parameters via supervised learning.

By noticing that both the prior $P_Z$ and the aggregated posterior $Q_Z$ of the latent code Z can be well captured by Gaussians, the proposed WWAE utilizes the closed-form of the squared Wasserstein-2 distance for two Gaussians in the optimization process. As a result, WWAE does not suffer from the sampling burden and it is computationally efficient by leveraging the reparameterization trick. Numerical results evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets including MNIST, fashion- MNIST and CelebA show that WWAE learns better latent structures than VAEs and generates samples of better visual quality and higher FID scores than VAEs and GANs."

We demonstrate HEBO's empirical efficacy on the NeurIPS 2020 Black-Box Optimisation challenge, where HEBO placed first. Upon further analysis, we observe that HEBO significantly outperforms existing black-box optimisers on 108 machine learning hyperparameter tuning tasks comprising the Bayesmark benchmark. Our findings indicate that the majority of hyper-parameter tuning tasks exhibit heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity, multi-objective acquisition ensembles with Pareto front solutions improve queried configurations, and robust acquisition maximisers afford empirical advantages relative to their non-robust counterparts.

Instead, we propose novel approaches to elicit and leverage side-information on equally deserving individuals to counter subordination between social groups.

In this paper, we propose to reduce the gap between monolingual models and the unified multilingual model by distilling the structural knowledge of several monolingual models (teachers) to the unified multilingual model (student). We propose two novel KD methods based on structure-level information: (1) approximately minimizes the distance between the student's and the teachers' structure level probability distributions, (2) aggregates the structure-level knowledge to local distributions and minimizes the distance between two local probability distributions. Our experiments on 4 multilingual tasks with 25 datasets show that our approaches outperform several strong baselines and have stronger zero-shot generalizability than both the baseline model and teacher models."

We validate this score with an in-depth and extensive scientific study, and observe that CNN models with the highest accuracy also have the best AVH scores. This agrees with an earlier finding that state-of-art models improve on the classification of harder examples. We observe that the training dynamics of AVH is vastly different compared to the training loss. Specifically, AVH quickly reaches a plateau for all samples even though the training loss keeps improving. This suggests the need for designing better loss functions that can target harder examples more effectively.

However, if the system dynamics and the reward function are unknown, a learning agent must discover an optimal controller via direct interaction with the environment. Such interactive data gathering commonly leads to divergence towards dangerous or uninformative regions of the state space unless additional regularization measures are taken. Prior works proposed bounding the information loss measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence at every policy improvement step to eliminate instability in the learning dynamics. In this paper, we consider a broader family of $f$-divergences, and more concretely $\\alpha$-divergences, which inherit the beneficial property of providing the policy improvement step in closed form at the same time yielding a corresponding dual objective for policy evaluation. Such entropic proximal policy optimization view gives a unified perspective on compatible actor-critic architectures. In particular, common least-squares value function estimation coupled with advantage-weighted maximum likelihood policy improvement is shown to correspond to the Pearson $\\chi^2$-divergence penalty. Other actor-critic pairs arise for various choices of the penalty-generating function $f$. On a concrete instantiation of our framework with the $\\alpha$-divergence, we carry out asymptotic analysis of the solutions for different values of $\\alpha$ and demonstrate the effects of the divergence function choice on common standard reinforcement learning problems."

A model of information propagation in a CNN is proposed via an analogy to an optical system, where bosonic particles (i.e. photons) are concentrated as the 2D spatial resolution of the image collapses to a focal point $1\\times 1=1$. A 3D space $(x,y,t)$ is defined by $(x,y)$ coordinates in the image plane and CNN layer $t$, where a principal ray $(0,0,t)$ runs in the direction of information propagation through both the optical axis and the image center pixel located at $(x,y)=(0,0)$, about which the sharpest possible spatial focus is limited to a circle of confusion in the image plane. Our novel insight is to model the principal optical ray $(0,0,t)$ as geometrically equivalent to the medial vector in the positive orthant $I(x,y) \\in R^{N+}$ of a $N$-channel activation space, e.g. along the greyscale (or luminance) vector $(t,t,t)$ in $RGB$ colour space. Information is thus concentrated into an energy potential $E(x,y,t)=\\|I(x,y,t)\\|^2$, which, particularly for bottleneck layers $t$ of generic CNNs, is highly concentrated and symmetric about the spatial origin $(0,0,t)$ and exhibits the well-known \"Sombrero\" potential of the boson particle. This symmetry is broken in classification, where bottleneck layers of generic pre-trained CNN models exhibit a consistent class-specific bias towards an angle $\\theta \\in U(1)$ defined simultaneously in the image plane and in activation feature space.

This work investigates the problem of disentangling the role of the neural structure and its edge weights, by showing that well-trained architectures may not need any link-specific fine-tuning of the weights. We compare the performance of such weight-free networks (in our case these are binary networks with {0, 1}-valued weights) with random, weight-agnostic, pruned and standard fully connected networks. To find the optimal weight-agnostic network, we use a novel and computationally efficient method that translates the hard architecture-search problem into a feasible optimization problem.More specifically, we look at the optimal task-specific architectures as the optimal configuration of binary networks with {0, 1}-valued weights, which can be found through an approximate gradient descent strategy. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm are obtained by bounding the error in the gradient approximation and its practical performance is evaluated on two real-world data sets.

        "abstract_text": "This paper proposes CANC, a Co-teaching Active Noise Cancellation method, applied in spatial computing to address deep learning trained with extreme noisy labels. Deep learning algorithms have been successful in spatial computing for land or building footprint recognition. However a lot of noise exists in ground truth labels due to how labels are collected in spatial computing and satellite imagery. Existing methods to deal with extreme label noise conduct clean sample selection and do not utilize the remaining samples. Such techniques can be wasteful due to the cost of data retrieval. Our proposed CANC algorithm not only conserves high-cost training samples but also provides active label correction to better improve robust deep learning with extreme noisy labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CANC for building footprint recognition for spatial computing."

Despite many efforts in this area, there were no rigorous theoretical guarantees on why existing neural net compression methods should work. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees on some hashing-based parameter reduction methods in neural nets. First, we introduce a neural net compression scheme based on random linear sketching (which is usually implemented efficiently via hashing), and show that the sketched (smaller) network is able to approximate the original network on all input data coming from any smooth and well-conditioned low-dimensional manifold. The sketched network can also be trained directly via back-propagation. Next, we study the previously proposed HashedNets architecture and show that the optimization landscape of one-hidden-layer HashedNets has a local strong convexity property similar to a normal fully connected neural network. We complement our theoretical results with empirical verifications."

The model calibration task, commonly referred to as \"history matching\", can be formalised as an ill-posed inverse problem where we aim to find the underlying spatial distribution of petrophysical properties that explain the observed dynamic data. We use a generative adversarial network pretrained on geostatistical object-based models to represent the distribution of rock properties for a synthetic model of a hydrocarbon reservoir. The dynamic behaviour of the reservoir fluids is modelled using a transient two-phase incompressible Darcy formulation. We invert for the underlying reservoir properties by first modeling property distributions using the pre-trained generative model then using the adjoint equations of the forward problem to perform gradient descent on the latent variables that control the output of the generative model. In addition to the dynamic observation data, we include well rock-type constraints by introducing an additional objective function. Our contribution shows that for a synthetic test case, we are able to obtain solutions to the inverse problem by optimising in the latent variable space of a deep generative model, given a set of transient observations of a non-linear forward problem."

They have been recently introduced as an effective visual representation for fashion image understanding. However, detecting fashion landmarks are challenging due to background clutters, human poses, and scales. To remove the above variations, previous works usually assumed bounding boxes of clothes are provided in training and test as additional annotations, which are expensive to obtain and inapplicable in practice. This work addresses unconstrained fashion landmark detection, where clothing bounding boxes are not provided in both training and test. To this end, we present a novel Deep LAndmark Network (DLAN), where bounding boxes and landmarks are jointly estimated and trained iteratively in an end-to-end manner. DLAN contains two dedicated modules, including a Selective Dilated Convolution for handling scale discrepancies, and a Hierarchical Recurrent Spatial Transformer for handling background clutters. To evaluate DLAN, we present a large-scale fashion landmark dataset, namely Unconstrained Landmark Database (ULD), consisting of 30K images. Statistics show that ULD is more challenging than existing datasets in terms of image scales, background clutters, and human poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DLAN over the state-of-the-art methods. DLAN also exhibits excellent generalization across different clothing categories and modalities, making it extremely suitable for real-world fashion analysis."

Second, we train deep neural networks on a large database for the NESTA 162-bus system to assess both N-1 security and small-signal stability.

However, since CNNs are usually over-parameterized, a pre-trained network always contain some invalid (unimportant) filters. These filters have relatively small $l_{1}$ norm and contribute little to the output (\\textbf{Reason}). While filter pruning removes these invalid filters for efficiency consideration, we tend to reactivate them to improve the representation capability of CNNs. In this paper, we introduce filter grafting (\\textbf{Method}) to achieve this goal. The activation is processed by grafting external information (weights) into invalid filters. To better perform the grafting, we develop a novel criterion to measure the information of filters and an adaptive weighting strategy to balance the grafted information among networks. After the grafting operation, the network has fewer invalid filters compared with its initial state, enpowering the model with more representation capacity. Meanwhile, since grafting is operated reciprocally on all networks involved, we find that grafting may lose the information of valid filters when improving invalid filters. To gain a universal improvement on both valid and invalid filters, we compensate grafting with distillation (\\textbf{Cultivation}) to overcome the drawback of grafting . Extensive experiments are performed on the classification and recognition tasks to show the superiority of our method.

Often, what is available is an intuitive but sparse reward function that only indicates whether the task is completed partially or fully. However, the lack of carefully designed, fine grain feedback implies that most existing RL algorithms fail to learn an acceptable policy in a reasonable time frame. This is because of the large number of exploration actions that the policy has to perform before it gets any useful feedback that it can learn from. In this work, we address this challenging problem by developing an algorithm that exploits the offline demonstration data generated by a sub-optimal behavior policy for faster and efficient online RL in such sparse reward settings. The proposed algorithm, which we call the Learning Online with Guidance Offline (LOGO) algorithm, merges a policy improvement step with an additional policy guidance step by using the offline demonstration data. The key idea is that by obtaining guidance from - not imitating - the offline data, LOGO orients its policy in the manner of the sub-optimal policy, while yet being able to learn beyond and approach optimality. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm, and provide a lower bound on the performance improvement in each learning episode. We also extend our algorithm to the even more challenging incomplete observation setting, where the demonstration data contains only a censored version of the true state observation."

In the encoding stage, the image feature is reduced to various smallscale spaces for multi-scale information extraction and fusion without a large amount of information loss. Then, a distillation network is used in the decoding stage, which allows the network benefit the most from residual learning while remaining sufficiently lightweight. Meanwhile, an information fusion strategy between distillation modules and feature channels is also carried out by attention mechanism.

The state of the reservoir model is defined using parameters that appear in the governing equations of the two-phase flow. A feedback loop training process referred to as deep reinforcement learning is used to train an artificial intelligence agent with such a capability. The training entails millions of flow simulations with varying reservoir model descriptions (structural, rock and fluid properties), operational constraints, and economic conditions. The parameters that define the reservoir model, operational constraints, and economic conditions are randomly sampled from a defined range of applicability. Several algorithmic treatments are introduced to enhance the training of the artificial intelligence agent. After appropriate training, the artificial intelligence agent provides an optimized field development plan instantly for new scenarios within the defined range of applicability.

Motivated by approaches to noise tolerance from classical learning theory, we introduce the Statistical Query (SQ) model for PAC-learning quantum states, and prove that algorithms in this model are indeed resilient to common forms of noise, including classification and depolarizing noise. We prove an exponential lower bound on learning stabilizer states in the SQ model. Even outside the SQ model, we prove that learning stabilizer states with noise is in general as hard as Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) using classical examples. Our results position the problem of learning stabilizer states as a natural quantum analogue of the classical problem of learning parities: easy in the noiseless setting, but seemingly intractable even with simple forms of noise."

Our method relies on ideas from representation learning theory to find a global common representation using all clients' data and learn a user-specific set of parameters leading to a personalized solution for each client. Furthermore, our method mitigates the effects of stragglers by adaptively selecting clients based on their computational characteristics and statistical significance, thus achieving, for the first time, near optimal sample complexity and provable logarithmic speedup.

Simple defenses such as dropout and differential privacy either fail to defend the attacks or seriously hurt test accuracy. We propose a practical defense which we call Double-Blind Collaborative Learning (DBCL). The high-level idea is to apply random matrix sketching to the parameters (aka weights) and re-generate random sketching after each iteration. DBCL prevents clients from conducting gradient-based privacy inferences which are the most effective attacks. DBCL works because from the attacker's perspective, sketching is effectively random noise that outweighs the signal.

In theory, even if the behavior policy is highly sub-optimal compared to the expert, we show that as long as the data from the behavior policy provides sufficient coverage on the expert state-action traces (and with no necessity for a global coverage over the entire state-action space), MILO can provably combat the covariate shift issue in IL.

In simulated data, our neural network (NN) is able to reconstruct the flux of inner Galaxy emission components to on average $\\sim$0.5%, comparable to the non-Poissonian template fit (NPTF). When applied to the actual $\\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, we find that the NN estimates for the flux fractions from the background templates are consistent with the NPTF; however, the GCE is almost entirely attributed to smooth emission. While suggestive, we do not claim a definitive resolution for the GCE, as the NN tends to underestimate the flux of point-sources peaked near the 1$\\sigma$ detection threshold. Yet the technique displays robustness to a number of systematics, including reconstructing injected DM, diffuse mismodeling, and unmodeled north-south asymmetries.

However, the low signal- to-noise ratio of financial data in combination with the auto-pruning property of a VAE typically makes the use of a VAE prone to posterior collapse. Therefore, we propose to use annealing of the regularization to mitigate this effect. As a result, the auto-pruning of the TempVAE works properly which also results in excellent estimation results for the VaR that beats classical GARCH-type and historical simulation approaches when applied to real data."

        "abstract_text": "The broadening adoption of machine learning in the enterprise is increasing the pressure for strict governance and cost-effective performance, in particular for the common and consequential steps of model storage and inference. The RDBMS provides a natural starting point, given its mature infrastructure for fast data access and processing, along with support for enterprise features (e.g., encryption, auditing, high-availability). To take advantage of all of the above, we need to address a key concern: Can in-RDBMS scoring of ML models match (outperform?) the performance of dedicated frameworks? We answer the above positively by building Raven, a system that leverages native integration of ML runtimes (i.e., ONNX Runtime) deep within SQL Server, and a unified intermediate representation (IR) to enable advanced cross-optimizations between ML and DB operators. In this optimization space, we discover the most exciting research opportunities that combine DB/Compiler/ML thinking. Our initial evaluation on real data demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.5x from the native integration of ML in SQL Server, and up to 24x from cross-optimizations--we will demonstrate Raven live during the conference talk."

        "abstract_text": "Graph embedding is essential for graph mining tasks. With the prevalence of graph data in real-world applications, many methods have been proposed in recent years to learn high-quality graph embedding vectors various types of graphs. However, most existing methods usually randomly select the negative samples from the original graph to enhance the training data without considering the noise. In addition, most of these methods only focus on the explicit graph structures and cannot fully capture complex semantics of edges such as various relationships or asymmetry. In order to address these issues, we propose a robust and generalized framework for adversarial graph embedding based on generative adversarial networks. Inspired by generative adversarial network, we propose a robust and generalized framework for adversarial graph embedding, named AGE. AGE generates the fake neighbor nodes as the enhanced negative samples from the implicit distribution, and enables the discriminator and generator to jointly learn each node's robust and generalized representation. Based on this framework, we propose three models to handle three types of graph data and derive the corresponding optimization algorithms, i.e., UG-AGE and DG-AGE for undirected and directed homogeneous graphs, respectively, and HIN-AGE for heterogeneous information networks. Extensive experiments show that our methods consistently and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple graph mining tasks, including link prediction, node classification, and graph reconstruction."

There are many parameters to be accounted for that can positively or adversely affect that schedule depending on their configuration - How work is shared between distributed targets, the subdivision of tensors to fit in memory, toggling the enablement of optimizations, etc. Traditionally, neural network compilers determine how to set these values by building a graph of choices and choosing the path with minimal 'cost'. These choices and their corresponding costs are usually determined by an algorithm crafted by engineers with a deep knowledge of the target platform. However, when the amount of options available to a compiler is large, it is very difficult to ensure that these models consistently produce an optimal schedule for all scenarios, whilst still completing compilation in an acceptable timeframe. This paper presents 'VPUNN' - a neural network-based cost model trained on low-level task profiling that consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art cost modeling in Intel's line of VPU processors."

We show that with a cluster size of N=4 on Resnet-101, can achieve 71.8% TOP-1 accuracy, within 6% of the best full precision results while replacing ~85% of all multiplications with 8-bit accumulations. Using the same method with 4-bit weights achieves 76.3% TOP-1 accuracy which within 2% of the full precision result. We also study the impact of the size of the cluster on both performance and accuracy, larger cluster sizes N=64 can replace ~98% of the multiplications with ternary operations but introduces significant drop in accuracy which necessitates fine tuning the parameters with retraining the network at lower precision. To address this we have also trained low-precision Resnet-50 with 8-bit activations and ternary weights by pre-initializing the network with full precision weights and achieve 68.9% TOP-1 accuracy within 4 additional epochs.

We introduce a novel Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) based measure called N-LID that measures the local deviation of a given data point's LID with respect to its neighbors. We then show that N-LID can distinguish poisoned samples from normal samples and propose an N-LID based defense approach that makes no assumptions of the attacker.

Converting this data to vector (tensor) representation is generally done by manual feature engineering, which is laborious, lossy, and prone to human bias about the importance of particular features.

In medical imaging, the heterogeneity of population, scanners and acquisition protocols at different sites presents a significant domain shift challenge and has limited the widespread clinical adoption of machine learning models. Harmonization methods which aim to learn a representation of data invariant to these differences are the prevalent tools to address domain shift, but they typically result in degradation of predictive accuracy. This paper takes a different perspective of the problem: we embrace this disharmony in data and design a simple but effective framework for tackling domain shift. The key idea, based on our theoretical arguments, is to build a pretrained classifier on the source data and adapt this model to new data. The classifier can be fine-tuned for intra-site domain adaptation. We can also tackle situations where we do not have access to ground-truth labels on target data; we show how one can use auxiliary tasks for adaptation; these tasks employ covariates such as age, gender and race which are easy to obtain but nevertheless correlated to the main task. We demonstrate substantial improvements in both intra-site domain adaptation and inter-site domain generalization on large-scale real-world 3D brain MRI datasets for classifying Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia."

Glioblastoma patients have a median survival of 12 months with optimal therapy and about 4 months without treatment. Glioblastomas appear as heterogeneous necrotic masses with irregular peripheral enhancement, surrounded by vasogenic edema. The current standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which require accurate segmentation of brain tumor subregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify the methylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a positive prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain tumor segmentation are tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current techniques to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoter involve surgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming. Hence there is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and non-invasive methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to facilitate better treatment planning and improve survival rate. I created an integrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial Intelligence to automatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter methylation status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large datasets with performance exceeding current standards and field tested with data from teaching files of local neuroradiologists. With my solution, physicians can submit brain MRI images, and get segmentation and methylation predictions in minutes, and guide brain tumor patients with effective treatment planning and ultimately improve survival time."

It is also able to create realistic interpolations between two musical sequences, smoothly changing the dynamics of the different tracks. Experiments show that the model can organise its latent space accordingly to low-level properties of the musical pieces, as well as to embed into the latent variables the high-level genre information injected from the prior distribution to increase its overall performance.

However, since labels for academic performance, such as test scores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly, leading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine learning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired by the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing community, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on academic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the sequence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training method, DPA is more sample efficient, leading to fast convergence to lower academic performance prediction error. We conduct extensive experimental studies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application and show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more robust to increased label-scarcity."

The research to date has tended to focus on using LID as a practical defence method often without fully explaining why LID can detect adversarial samples. In this paper, we derive a lower-bound and an upper-bound for the LID value of a perturbed data point and demonstrate that the bounds, in particular the lower-bound, has a positive correlation with the magnitude of the perturbation. Hence, we demonstrate that data points that are perturbed by a large amount would have large LID values compared to unperturbed samples, thus justifying its use in the prior literature.

However, it is not trivial to estimate such scores by considering changes of relationships between the elements, which strongly correlate with each other. Moreover, it is necessary to estimate the scores for the entire system and its elements from a single framework, in order to identify relationships among the scores for localizing elements associated with anomaly. Here, we developed a new method to quantify anomalousness of an entire system and its elements simultaneously. The purpose of this paper is threefold. The first one is to propose a new anomaly detection method: Double Kernelized Scoring (DKS). DKS is a unified framework for entire-system anomaly scoring and element-wise anomaly scoring. Therefore, DKS allows for conducting simultaneously 1) anomaly detection for the entire system and 2) localization for identifying faulty elements responsible for the system anomaly. The second purpose is to propose a new kernel function: Matrix Kernel. The Matrix Kernel is defined between general matrices, which might have different dimensions, allowing for conducting anomaly detection on systems where the number of elements change over time.

So, a personalized model that recommends the right item to the right user at the right time is the key to building such a model.

Specifically, we decompose the commonly adopted loss (e.g., mean squared loss) function into a label-dependent part and a label-independent part, in which only the former is influenced by label noise. Further, by defining a new form of data centroid, we transform the recovery problem of a label-dependent part to a centroid estimation problem. Finally, by critically examining the mathematical expectation of clean data centroid given the observed noisy set, the centroid can be estimated which helps to build an unbiased risk estimator for multi-class learning. The proposed MC-LDCE method is general and applicable to different types (i.e., linear and nonlinear) of classification models. The experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MC-LDCE against other representative LNL methods in tackling multi-class label noise problem."

        "abstract_text": "Even though it is well known that for most relevant computational problems different algorithms may perform better on different classes of problem instances, most researchers still focus on determining a single best algorithmic configuration based on aggregate results such as the average. In this paper, we propose Integer Programming based approaches to build decision trees for the Algorithm Selection Problem. These techniques allow automate three crucial decisions: (i) discerning the most important problem features to determine problem classes; (ii) grouping the problems into classes and (iii) select the best algorithm configuration for each class. To evaluate this new approach, extensive computational experiments were executed using the linear programming algorithms implemented in the COIN-OR Branch & Cut solver across a comprehensive set of instances, including all MIPLIB benchmark instances. The results exceeded our expectations. While selecting the single best parameter setting across all instances decreased the total running time by 22%, our approach decreased the total running time by 40% on average across 10-fold cross validation experiments. These results indicate that our method generalizes quite well and does not overfit."

        "abstract_text": "Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data that takes account of the impact of neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles to different clusters. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the solution constitutes the message passing propagation. The mechanism behind ACMP is phase transition of particles which enables the formation of multi-clusters and thus GNNs prediction for node classification. ACMP can propel the network depth to hundreds of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs which circumvents the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. Experiments for various real node classification datasets, with possible high homophily difficulty, show the GNNs with ACMP can achieve state of the art performance with no decay of Dirichlet energy."

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions.

In particular, the forecasting of geomagnetic indices with neural network models is becoming a popular field of study. These models are evaluated with metrics such as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient. However, these classical metrics sometimes fail to capture crucial behavior. To show where the classical metrics are lacking, we trained a neural network, using a long short-term memory network, to make a forecast of the disturbance storm time index at origin time $t$ with a forecasting horizon of 1 up to 6 hours, trained on OMNIWeb data. Inspection of the model's results with the correlation coefficient and RMSE indicated a performance comparable to the latest publications. However, visual inspection showed that the predictions made by the neural network were behaving similarly to the persistence model. In this work, a new method is proposed to measure whether two time series are shifted in time with respect to each other, such as the persistence model output versus the observation. The new measure, based on Dynamical Time Warping, is capable of identifying results made by the persistence model and shows promising results in confirming the visual observations of the neural network's output. Finally, different methodologies for training the neural network are explored in order to remove the persistence behavior from the results."

The feature attribution framework distributes a GNN's prediction to its input features (e.g., edges), identifying an influential subgraph as the explanation. When evaluating the explanation (i.e., subgraph importance), a standard way is to audit the model prediction based on the subgraph solely. However, we argue that a distribution shift exists between the full graph and the subgraph, causing the out-of-distribution problem. Furthermore, with an in-depth causal analysis, we find the OOD effect acts as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the subgraph importance and model prediction, making the evaluation less reliable. In this work, we propose Deconfounded Subgraph Evaluation (DSE) which assesses the causal effect of an explanatory subgraph on the model prediction. While the distribution shift is generally intractable, we employ the front-door adjustment and introduce a surrogate variable of the subgraphs. Specifically, we devise a generative model to generate the plausible surrogates that conform to the data distribution, thus approaching the unbiased estimation of subgraph importance. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DSE in terms of explanation fidelity."

The combined activation signals produced by all neurons in a given layer form the representation of the input image in that feature space.

This paper introduces the novel multi-agent counterfactual communication learning (MACC) method which adapts counterfactual reasoning in order to overcome the credit assignment problem for communicating agents. Secondly, the non-stationarity of the communication environment while learning the communication Q-function is overcome by creating the communication Q-function using the action policy of the other agents and the Q-function of the action environment. Additionally, a social loss function is introduced in order to create influenceable agents which is required to learn a valid communication protocol.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been massively applied to the field of social bot detection, a huge amount of domain expertise and prior knowledge is heavily engaged in the state-of-the art approaches to design a dedicated neural network architecture for a specific classification task. Involving oversized nodes and network layers in the model design, however, usually causes the over-smoothing problem and the lack of embedding discrimination. In this paper, we propose RoSGAS, a novel Reinforced and Self-supervised GNN Architecture Search framework to adaptively pinpoint the most suitable multi-hop neighborhood and the number of layers in the GNN architecture. More specifically, we consider the social bot detection problem as a user-centric subgraph embedding and classification task. We exploit heterogeneous information network to present the user connectivity by leveraging account metadata, relationships, behavioral features and content features. RoSGAS uses a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism for navigating the search of optimal neighborhood and network layers to learn individually the subgraph embedding for each target user. A nearest neighbor mechanism is developed for accelerating the RL training process, and RoSGAS can learn more discriminative subgraph embedding with the aid of self-supervised learning.

In previous work, many kinds of different data have been modeled as networks: social structure, navigational structure, transport infrastructure, communication, etc. Almost all these types of networks are not static structures, but instead dynamic systems that change continuously. Thus, an important question concerns the trends observable in these networks and their interpretation in terms of existing network models. We show in this article that most numerical network characteristics follow statistically significant trends going either up or down, and that these trends can be predicted by considering the notion of diversity. Our work extends previous work observing a shrinking network diameter to measures such as the clustering coefficient, power-law exponent and random walk return probability, and justifies preferential attachment models and link prediction algorithms.

More specifically, in each conditional convolution layer, the weights are conditioned in a simple but effective way through filter-wise scaling and channel-wise shifting operations. In contrast to the conventional methods, the proposed method with a single generator can effectively handle condition-specific characteristics.

This $\\ell_2$-approximation minimizes the sum over every entry to the power of $p=2$ in the matrix $A - A_{k,2}$, among every matrix $A_{k,2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ whose rank is $k$.

This paper suggests to replace the $k$-rank $\\ell_2$ approximation by $\\ell_p$, for $p\\in [1,2]$. We then provide practical and provable approximation algorithms to compute it for any $p\\geq1$, based on modern techniques in computational geometry. Extensive experimental results on the GLUE benchmark for compressing BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa confirm this theoretical advantage.

        "abstract_text": "Bitcoin, with its ever-growing popularity, has demonstrated extreme price volatility since its origin. This volatility, together with its decentralised nature, make Bitcoin highly subjective to speculative trading as compared to more traditional assets. In this paper, we propose a multimodal model for predicting extreme price fluctuations. This model takes as input a variety of correlated assets, technical indicators, as well as Twitter content. In an in-depth study, we explore whether social media discussions from the general public on Bitcoin have predictive power for extreme price movements. A dataset of 5,000 tweets per day containing the keyword `Bitcoin' was collected from 2015 to 2021. This dataset, called PreBit, is made available online. In our hybrid model, we use sentence-level FinBERT embeddings, pretrained on financial lexicons, so as to capture the full contents of the tweets and feed it to the model in an understandable way. By combining these embeddings with a Convolutional Neural Network, we built a predictive model for significant market movements. The final multimodal ensemble model includes this NLP model together with a model based on candlestick data, technical indicators and correlated asset prices. In an ablation study, we explore the contribution of the individual modalities. Finally, we propose and backtest a trading strategy based on the predictions of our models with varying prediction threshold and show that it can used to build a profitable trading strategy with a reduced risk over a `hold' or moving average strategy."

Moreover, user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data towards yielding an IID dataset.

Unfortunately, the RWA cannot change the attention it has assigned to previous timesteps, and so struggles with carrying out consecutive tasks or tasks with changing requirements. We present the Recurrent Discounted Attention (RDA) unit that builds on the RWA by additionally allowing the discounting of the past. We empirically compare our model to RWA, LSTM and GRU units on several challenging tasks. On tasks with a single output the RWA, RDA and GRU units learn much quicker than the LSTM and with better performance. On the multiple sequence copy task our RDA unit learns the task three times as quickly as the LSTM or GRU units while the RWA fails to learn at all.

In the exploration phase, selection of experiments is such that a moderate level of confidence on the true hypothesis is achieved. Subsequent experiment design aims at improving the confidence level on this hypothesis to the desired level. In this paper, the focus is on the verification phase. A confidence measure is defined and active hypothesis testing is formulated as a confidence maximization problem in an infinite-horizon average-reward Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting. The problem of maximizing confidence conditioned on a particular hypothesis is referred to as the hypothesis verification problem. The relationship between hypothesis testing and verification problems is established. The verification problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Optimal solutions for the verification MDP are characterized and a simple heuristic adaptive strategy for verification is proposed based on a zero-sum game interpretation of Kullback-Leibler divergences. It is demonstrated through numerical experiments that the heuristic performs better in some scenarios compared to existing methods in literature."

The data are curated from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) with the goal of predicting the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). While the majority of the existing machine learning models that have been used on this class of data are vulnerable to class imbalance even after the adjustment of class-specific weights, our simple two-layer CNN exhibits resilience to the imbalance with fair harmony in class-specific performance. In order to obtain significant improvement in classification accuracy under supervised learning settings, it is a common practice to train a neural network architecture with a massive data and thereafter, test the resulting network on a comparatively smaller amount of data. However, given a highly imbalanced dataset, it is often challenging to achieve a high class 1 (true CHD prediction rate) accuracy as the testing data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we employ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature weight assessment followed by majority-voting based identification of important features. Next, the important features are homogenized by using a fully connected layer, a crucial step before passing the output of the layer to successive convolutional stages. We also propose a training routine per epoch, akin to a simulated annealing process, to boost the classification accuracy."

This can be alleviated through intelligent choice of action space. Operational Space Control (OSC) has been used as an effective task-space controller for manipulation. Nonetheless, its strength depends on the underlying modeling fidelity, and is prone to failure when there are modeling errors. In this work, we propose OSC for Adaptation and Robustness (OSCAR), a data-driven variant of OSC that compensates for modeling errors by inferring relevant dynamics parameters from online trajectories. OSCAR decomposes dynamics learning into task-agnostic and task-specific phases, decoupling the dynamics dependencies of the robot and the extrinsics due to its environment. This structure enables robust zero-shot performance under out-of-distribution and rapid adaptation to significant domain shifts through additional finetuning. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated manipulation problems, and find substantial improvements over an array of controller baselines.

Our results help demystify why training and generalization is easier on clean and structured datasets and harder on noisy and unstructured datasets as well as how the network size affects the evolution of the train and test errors during training. Specifically, we use a control knob to split the Jacobian spectum into \"information\" and \"nuisance\" spaces associated with the large and small singular values. We show that over the information space learning is fast and one can quickly train a model with zero training loss that can also generalize well. Over the nuisance space training is slower and early stopping can help with generalization at the expense of some bias. We also show that the overall generalization capability of the network is controlled by how well the label vector is aligned with the information space. A key feature of our results is that even constant width neural nets can provably generalize for sufficiently nice datasets."

In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Our novel approach learns the appropriate structural role dynamics for any arbitrary network and tracks the changes over time. In particular, we uncover the specific global network dynamics and the local node dynamics of a technological, communication, and social network. We identify interesting node and network patterns such as stationary and non-stationary roles, spikes/steps in role-memberships (perhaps indicating anomalies), increasing/decreasing role trends, among many others. Our results indicate that the nodes in each of these networks have distinct connectivity patterns that are non-stationary and evolve considerably over time. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for fast mining and tracking of the dynamics in large networks. Furthermore, the dynamic structural representation provides a basis for building more sophisticated models and tools that are fast for exploring large dynamic networks."

These parameters control the size and structure of communities that are formed by optimizing a generalized objective function. We begin by formalizing the notion of a parameter fitness function, which measures how well a fixed input clustering approximately solves a generalized clustering objective for a specific resolution parameter value. Under reasonable assumptions, which suit two key graph clustering applications, such a parameter fitness function can be efficiently minimized using a bisection-like method, yielding a resolution parameter that fits well with the example clustering. We view our framework as a type of single-shot hyperparameter tuning, as we are able to learn a good resolution parameter with just a single example. Our general approach can be applied to learn resolution parameters for both local and global graph clustering objectives.

We address these two related issues by learning flexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic. This adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the representation, and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures there is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive variable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making decisions free from discrimination and removing private information from images. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem, and optimize that minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer. We demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for standard test problems, and compare with previous state of the art methods for fairness, showing statistically significant improvement across most cases.

In this paper, we point out the two types of artificial node features,i.e., positional and structural node features, and provide insights on why each of them is more appropriate for certain tasks,i.e., positional node classification, structural node classification, and graph classification.

It converges to an equilibrium by iteratively traversing the game tree. In order to deal with extremely large games, abstraction is typically applied before running CFR. The abstracted game is solved with tabular CFR, and its solution is mapped back to the full game. This process can be problematic because aspects of abstraction are often manual and domain specific, abstraction algorithms may miss important strategic nuances of the game, and there is a chicken-and-egg problem because determining a good abstraction requires knowledge of the equilibrium of the game. This paper introduces Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization, a form of CFR that obviates the need for abstraction by instead using deep neural networks to approximate the behavior of CFR in the full game. We show that Deep CFR is principled and achieves strong performance in large poker games. This is the first non-tabular variant of CFR to be successful in large games."

        "abstract_text": "There is an increasing demand for scalable algorithms capable of clustering and analyzing large time series datasets. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and clustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting influential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it accommodates the distortions when aligning time series. Despite its use in clustering, DTW is limited in practice because it is quadratic in runtime complexity with the length of the time series data. To address this, we present a new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for TIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based clustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational performance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW computations during the SOM's training phase. We also implemented a similar pruning strategy for K-means for comparison with one of the top performing clustering algorithms. We evaluated the pruning effectiveness, accuracy, execution time and scalability on 112 benchmark time series datasets from the University of California, Riverside classification archive. We showed that for similar accuracy, the speed-up achieved for SOMTimeS and K-means was 1.8x on average; however, rates varied between 1x and 18x depending on the dataset. SOMTimeS and K-means pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations, respectively."

This article conducts a large dimensional analysis of a simple but, as we shall see, extremely powerful when carefully tuned, Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) version of MTL, in the regime where the dimension $p$ of the data and their number $n$ grow large at the same rate. Under mild assumptions on the input data, the theoretical analysis of the MTL-LSSVM algorithm first reveals the \"sufficient statistics\" exploited by the algorithm and their interaction at work. These results demonstrate, as a striking consequence, that the standard approach to MTL-LSSVM is largely suboptimal, can lead to severe effects of negative transfer but that these impairments are easily corrected. These corrections are turned into an improved MTL-LSSVM algorithm which can only benefit from additional data, and the theoretical performance of which is also analyzed. As evidenced and theoretically sustained in numerous recent works, these large dimensional results are robust to broad ranges of data distributions, which our present experiments corroborate. Specifically, the article reports a systematically close behavior between theoretical and empirical performances on popular datasets, which is strongly suggestive of the applicability of the proposed carefully tuned MTL-LSSVM method to real data. This fine-tuning is fully based on the theoretical analysis and does not in particular require any cross validation procedure. Besides, the reported performances on real datasets almost systematically outperform much more elaborate and less intuitive state-of-the-art multi-task and transfer learning methods."

However, there is a lack of theoretical insights into why and when this method of transferring knowledge can be successful between such heterogeneous tasks. We analyze this method theoretically using deep linear networks, and experimentally using nonlinear networks. We identify three vital factors to the success of the method: (1) whether the student is trained to zero training loss; (2) how knowledgeable the teacher is on the clean-input problem; (3) how the teacher decomposes its knowledge in its hidden features. Lack of proper control in any of the three factors leads to failure of the student-teacher learning method."

The stocks in a market can share information so that their stock prices are highly correlated. Several methods were recently proposed to mine the shared information through stock concepts (e.g., technology, Internet Retail) extracted from the Web to improve the forecasting results. However, previous work assumes the connections between stocks and concepts are stationary, and neglects the dynamic relevance between stocks and concepts, limiting the forecasting results. Moreover, existing methods overlook the invaluable shared information carried by hidden concepts, which measure stocks' commonness beyond the manually defined stock concepts. To overcome the shortcomings of previous work, we proposed a novel stock trend forecasting framework that can adequately mine the concept-oriented shared information from predefined concepts and hidden concepts. The proposed framework simultaneously utilize the stock's shared information and individual information to improve the stock trend forecasting performance. Experimental results on the real-world tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our framework on stock trend forecasting.

We show that it is due to the mismatch between the conventional logarithm and the non-logarithmic (generalized) nature of Tsallis entropy. Drawing inspiration from the Tsallis statistics literature, we propose to correct the mismatch of M-RL with the help of $q$-logarithm/exponential functions. The proposed formulation leads to implicit Tsallis KL regularization under the maximum Tsallis entropy framework.

However, on very constrained hardware the time necessary to train such models would be high. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we extensively test an end-to-end vanilla neural network (MLP) approach in pure numpy without any pre-processing or feature extraction done beforehand. Second, we show that basic data mining operations can significantly improve the performance of the models in terms of computational time, without sacrificing much accuracy. We illustrate our claims on a simpler variant of the Extended MNIST dataset, called Balanced EMNIST dataset. Our experiments show that, without any data mining, we get increased generalization performance when using more hidden layers and regularization techniques, the best model achieving 84.83% accuracy on a test dataset. Using dimensionality reduction done by PCA we were able to increase that figure to 85.08% with only 10% of the original feature space, reducing the memory size needed by 64%. Finally, adding methods to remove possibly harmful training samples like deviation from the mean helped us to still achieve over 84% test accuracy but with only 32.8% of the original memory size for the training set. This compares favorably to the majority of literature results obtained through similar architectures. Although this approach gets outshined by state-of-the-art models, it does scale to some (AlexNet, VGGNet) trained on 50% of the same dataset."

The challenge arises as traffic flows often exhibit intrinsic and latent spatio-temporal correlations that cannot be identified by extracting the spatial and temporal patterns of traffic data separately. We argue that such correlations are universal and play a pivotal role in traffic flow. We put forward {spacetime interval learning} as a paradigm to explicitly capture these correlations through a unified analysis of both spatial and temporal features. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, which are restricted to a particular road network, we model the universal spatio-temporal correlations that are transferable from cities to cities. To this end, we propose a new spacetime interval learning framework that constructs a local-spacetime context of a traffic sensor comprising the data from its neighbors within close time points. Based on this idea, we introduce local spacetime neural network (STNN), which employs novel spacetime convolution and attention mechanism to learn the universal spatio-temporal correlations. The proposed STNN captures local traffic patterns, which does not depend on a specific network structure. As a result, a trained STNN model can be applied on any unseen traffic networks. We evaluate the proposed STNN on two public real-world traffic datasets and a simulated dataset on dynamic networks. The experiment results show that STNN not only improves prediction accuracy by 4% over state-of-the-art methods, but is also effective in handling the case when the traffic network undergoes dynamic changes as well as the superior generalization capability."

The transformation progressively fades-out as long as training proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and extend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired by the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine Learning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of altering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at the current stage of the training procedure. The auxiliary network is trained jointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth' of the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data alteration process.

Stochastic models are critical to study as they more accurately represent the real-world than their deterministic counterparts. Although there have been extensive studies in solving routing problems under uncertainty, very few have considered UCARP, and none consider collaboration between vehicles to handle the negative effects of uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel Solution Construction Procedure (SCP) that generates solutions to UCARP within a collaborative, multi-vehicle framework. It consists of two types of collaborative activities: one when a vehicle unexpectedly expends capacity (\\emph{route failure}), and the other during the refill process. Then, we propose a Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) algorithm to evolve the routing policy used within the collaborative framework. The experimental studies show that the new heuristic with vehicle collaboration and GP-evolved routing policy significantly outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms on commonly studied test problems. This is shown to be especially true on instances with larger numbers of tasks and vehicles. This clearly shows the advantage of vehicle collaboration in handling the uncertain environment, and the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm."

Recently, learning the Laplacian representation has been framed as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to overcome its computational limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces. However, this approach requires uniform access to all states in the state space, overlooking the exploration problem that emerges during the representation learning process. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is able to recover, in a non-uniform-prior setting, the expressiveness and the desired properties of the Laplacian representation. We do so by combining the representation learning with a skill-based covering policy, which provides a better training distribution to extend and refine the representation. We also show that a simple augmentation of the representation objective with the learned temporal abstractions improves dynamics-awareness and helps exploration. We find that our method succeeds as an alternative to the Laplacian in the non-uniform setting and scales to challenging continuous control environments.

        "abstract_text": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. It is usually found in patients who suffer from diabetes for a long period. The major focus of this work is to derive optimal representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction. Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer converges more quickly when trained using blended features, compared to the same model trained using uni-modal deep features."

To that end, we propose a generative time-to-event model, SurvLatent ODE, which adopts an Ordinary Differential Equation-based Recurrent Neural Networks (ODE-RNN) as an encoder to effectively parameterize a latent representation under irregularly sampled data. Our model then utilizes the latent representation to flexibly estimate survival times for multiple competing events without specifying shapes of event-specific hazard function. We demonstrate competitive performance of our model on MIMIC-III, a freely-available longitudinal dataset collected from critical care units, on predicting hospital mortality as well as the data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) on predicting onset of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a life-threatening complication for patients with cancer, with death as a competing event.

For this reason, there has been a growing interest in the anomaly detection (AD) task. Since we cannot observe abnormal samples for most of the cases, recent AD methods attempt to formulate it as a task of classifying whether the sample is normal or not. However, they potentially fail when the given normal samples are inherited from diverse semantic labels. To tackle this problem, we introduce a latent class-condition-based AD scenario. In addition, we propose a confidence-based self-labeling AD framework tailored to our proposed scenario. Since our method leverages the hidden class information, it successfully avoids generating the undesirable loose decision region that one-class methods suffer. Our proposed framework outperforms the recent one-class AD methods in the latent multi-class scenarios."

For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network, without any prior assumptions. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types."

We use this result to obtain strong and in many cases nearly optimal lower bounds on the sample complexity for testing unions of intervals, halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, polynomial threshold functions, and decision trees. Conversely, we show that two natural classes of functions, juntas and monotone functions, can be tested with a number of samples that is polynomially smaller than the number of samples required for PAC learning.

This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of that network.

In this work, we come up with the idea that instead of static plugins that the currently available loss functions are, they should by default be flexible in nature. A flexible loss function can be a more insightful navigator for neural networks leading to higher convergence rates and therefore reaching the optimum accuracy more quickly. The insights to help decide the degree of flexibility can be derived from the complexity of ANNs, the data distribution, selection of hyper-parameters and so on. In the wake of this, we introduce a novel flexible loss function for neural networks. The function is shown to characterize a range of fundamentally unique properties from which, much of the properties of other loss functions are only a subset and varying the flexibility parameter in the function allows it to emulate the loss curves and the learning behavior of prevalent static loss functions. The extensive experimentation performed with the loss function demonstrates that it is able to give state-of-the-art performance on selected data sets. Thus, in all the idea of flexibility itself and the proposed function built upon it carry the potential to open to a new interesting chapter in deep learning research."

The simulated annealing showed to significantly outperform hill climbing, FNN, CNN, and an evolutionary theory algorithm achieving 100% accuracy in 30 unique board configurations.

Numerical solutions to such problems are well-established. However, these are often too slow to be used directly in real-time applications. The alternative is to learn solution manifolds for control problems in an offline stage. Although this distillation process can be trivially formulated as a behavioral cloning (BC) problem in an imitation learning setting, our experiments highlight a number of significant shortcomings arising due to incompatible local minima, interpolation artifacts, and insufficient coverage of the state space. In this paper, we propose an alternative to BC that is efficient and numerically robust. We formulate the learning of solution manifolds as a minimization of the energy terms of a control objective integrated over the space of problems of interest. We minimize this energy integral with a novel method that combines Monte Carlo-inspired adaptive sampling strategies with the derivatives used to solve individual instances of the control task. We evaluate the performance of our formulation on a series of robotic control problems of increasing complexity, and we highlight its benefits through comparisons against traditional methods such as behavioral cloning and Dataset aggregation (Dagger)."

Through the tool of manifold identification from nonlinear optimization, we prove that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation and dropout that complicate the training process. Experiments on training NNs with structured sparsity confirm that variance reduction is necessary for such an identification, and show that RMDA thus significantly outperforms existing methods for this task.

To tackle this challenge, some recent works have demonstrated the gains of leveraging available OOD sets for training end-to-end calibrated CNNs. However, a critical question remains unanswered in these works: how to differentiate OOD sets for selecting the most effective one(s) that induce training such CNNs with high detection rates on unseen OOD sets? To address this pivotal question, we provide a criterion based on generalization errors of Augmented-CNN, a vanilla CNN with an added extra class employed for rejection, on in-distribution and unseen OOD sets. However, selecting the most effective OOD set by directly optimizing this criterion incurs a huge computational cost. Instead, we propose three novel computationally-efficient metrics for differentiating between OOD sets according to their \"protection\" level of in-distribution sub-manifolds. We empirically verify that the most protective OOD sets -- selected according to our metrics -- lead to A-CNNs with significantly lower generalization errors than the A-CNNs trained on the least protective ones. We also empirically show the effectiveness of a protective OOD set for training well-generalized confidence-calibrated vanilla CNNs. These results confirm that 1) all OOD sets are not equally effective for training well-performing end-to-end models (i.e., A-CNNs and calibrated CNNs) for OOD detection tasks and 2) the protection level of OOD sets is a viable factor for recognizing the most effective one."

In this paper, we apply frame theory to the sparse representation of signals in which a synthesis dictionary is used for a frame and an analysis dictionary is used for a dual frame. We sought to formulate a novel dual frame design in which the sparse vector obtained through the decomposition of any signal is also the sparse solution representing signals based on a reconstruction frame. Our findings demonstrate that this type of dual frame cannot be constructed for over-complete frames, thereby precluding the use of any linear analysis operator in driving the sparse synthesis coefficient for signal representation. Nonetheless, the best approximation to the sparse synthesis solution can be derived from the analysis coefficient using the canonical dual frame. In this study, we developed a novel dictionary learning algorithm (called Parseval K-SVD) to learn a tight-frame dictionary. We then leveraged the analysis and synthesis perspectives of signal representation with frames to derive optimization formulations for problems pertaining to image recovery.

This puts huge pressure on the available system resources such as interconnect and memory bandwidth. The optimal partitioning of the feature maps for these sub-tasks can reduce the bandwidth requirement substantially. Some accelerators avoid off-chip or interconnect transfers by implementing local memories; however, the memory accesses are still performed and a reduced bandwidth can help in saving power in such architectures. In this paper, we propose a first order analytical method to partition the feature maps for optimal bandwidth and evaluate the impact of such partitioning on the bandwidth. This bandwidth can be saved by designing an active memory controller which can perform basic arithmetic operations.

Moreover, we propose a risk based reward function which punishes risky situations instead of only collision failures. Such rewarding approach helps to incorporate risk prediction into our deep Q network and learn more reliable policies which are safer in challenging situations. The efficiency of the proposed approach is compared with a DQN learned with conventional collision based rewarding scheme and also with a rule-based intersection navigation policy. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach outperforms both of these methods. It provides safer actions than collision-aware DQN approach and is less overcautious than the rule-based policy."

Although short distance has been used in several papers, long distances have been ignored and will be investigated in this paper.

First, different anchoring strategies are proposed, with the objective of adapting the LR computation process to the case at hand, always respecting the propositions defined for the particular case. Second, a fully-Bayesian Gaussian model is used to tackle the sparsity in the training scores that is often present when the proposed anchoring strategies are used. Experiments are performed using the 2014 i-Vector challenge set-up, which presents high variability in a telephone speech context. The results show that the proposed fully-Bayesian model clearly outperforms a more common Maximum-Likelihood approach, leading to high robustness when the scores to train the model become sparse."

It computes the $\\epsilon$-neighborhood graph of a dataset and uses the connected components of the high-degree nodes to decide the clusters. However, the full neighborhood graph may be too costly to compute with a worst-case complexity of $O(n^2)$. In this paper, we propose a simple variant called SNG-DBSCAN, which clusters based on a subsampled $\\epsilon$-neighborhood graph, only requires access to similarity queries for pairs of points and in particular avoids any complex data structures which need the embeddings of the data points themselves. The runtime of the procedure is $O(sn^2)$, where $s$ is the sampling rate. We show under some natural theoretical assumptions that $s \\approx \\log n/n$ is sufficient for statistical cluster recovery guarantees leading to an $O(n\\log n)$ complexity. We provide an extensive experimental analysis showing that on large datasets, one can subsample as little as $0.1\\%$ of the neighborhood graph, leading to as much as over 200x speedup and 250x reduction in RAM consumption compared to scikit-learn's implementation of DBSCAN, while still maintaining competitive clustering performance."

In this paper, we focus on extracting the most specific set of CPs to discover significant changes between two datasets. Our approach to this problem uses closed patterns to substantially reduce redundant patterns. Our experimental results on several real and emulated network traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised algorithm is up to 100 times faster than an existing approach for CPM on network traffic data [2].

However, it is not clear if benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e., examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations. Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks, despite overfitting the noisy training data.

For a complex structure, brute force Monte Carlo simulation for response variation analysis is infeasible since one single run may already be computationally costly. Data driven meta-modeling approaches have thus been explored to facilitate efficient emulation and statistical inference. The performance of a meta-model hinges upon both the quality and quantity of training dataset. In actual practice, however, high-fidelity data acquired from high-dimensional finite element simulation or experiment are generally scarce, which poses significant challenge to meta-model establishment. In this research, we take advantage of the multi-level response prediction opportunity in structural dynamic analysis, i.e., acquiring rapidly a large amount of low-fidelity data from reduced-order modeling, and acquiring accurately a small amount of high-fidelity data from full-scale finite element analysis. Specifically, we formulate a composite neural network fusion approach that can fully utilize the multi-level, heterogeneous datasets obtained. It implicitly identifies the correlation of the low- and high-fidelity datasets, which yields improved accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art. Comprehensive investigations using frequency response variation characterization as case example are carried out to demonstrate the performance."

Training and inference with these models create storage, and memory bandwidth bottlenecks leading to significant computing and energy consumption when deployed in practice. To this end, we present the problem of \\textit{Memory Allocation} under budget for embeddings and propose a novel formulation of memory shared embedding, where memory is shared in proportion to the overlap in semantic information. Our formulation admits a practical and efficient randomized solution with Locality sensitive hashing based Memory Allocation (LMA).

The QCE is demonstrated to possess well-controlled error and time cost, which avoids the error accumulations by aiming at finding the shortest path directly to the target unitary. We test four different encapsulation ways to realize the multi-qubit quantum Fourier transformations by controlling the time evolution of the quantum Ising chain. The scaling behaviors of the time costs and errors against the number of two-qubit controlled gates are demonstrated.

Previous meta learning approaches finetune all parameters for each new user, which is both computing and storage expensive.

The fixed part, capturing user invariant features, is shared by all users and is learned during offline meta learning stage. The adaptive part, capturing user specific features, is learned during online meta learning stage. By decoupling user invariant parameters from user dependent parameters, the proposed approach is more efficient and storage cheaper than previous methods. It also has potential to deal with catastrophic forgetting while continually adapting for streaming coming users. Experiments on production data demonstrates that the proposed method converges faster and to a better performance than baseline methods. Meta-training without online meta model finetuning increases the AUC from 72.24% to 74.72% (2.48% absolute improvement). Online meta training achieves a further gain of 2.46\\% absolute improvement comparing with offline meta training."

To this end, we propose to combine the characteristics of individual graph layers using tools from subspace analysis on a Grassmann manifold. The resulting combination can then be viewed as a low dimensional representation of the original data which preserves the most important information from diverse relationships between entities. We use this information in new clustering methods and test our algorithm on several synthetic and real world datasets where we demonstrate superior or competitive performances compared to baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.

While conventional deep learning methods often yield deterministic results, advances in deep Bayesian learning allow for accurate predictions with a probabilistic interpretation in numerous image classification and segmentation tasks. It is however nontrivial to extend such Bayesian methods to cell detection, which requires specialized learning frameworks. In particular, regression of density maps is a popular successful approach for extracting cell coordinates from local peaks in a postprocessing step, which hinders any meaningful probabilistic output. We herein propose a deep learning-based cell detection framework that can operate on large microscopy images and outputs desired probabilistic predictions by (i) integrating Bayesian techniques for the regression of uncertainty-aware density maps, where peak detection can be applied to generate cell proposals, and (ii) learning a mapping from the numerous proposals to a probabilistic space that is calibrated, i.e. accurately represents the chances of a successful prediction. Utilizing such calibrated predictions, we propose a probabilistic spatial analysis with Monte-Carlo sampling. We demonstrate this in revising an existing description of the distribution of a mesenchymal stromal cell type within the bone marrow, where our proposed methods allow us to reveal spatial patterns that are otherwise undetectable."

We rely on the causal Markov and faithfulness assumptions and recover the equivalence class of the underlying causal graph by performing a series of conditional independence (CI) tests between observed variables. We propose a single step that is applied iteratively, such that the independence and causal relations entailed from the resulting graph, after any iteration, is correct and becomes more informative with successive iteration. Essentially, we tie the size of the CI condition set to its distance from the tested nodes on the resulting graph. Each iteration refines the skeleton and orientation by performing CI tests having condition sets that are larger than in the preceding iteration. In an iteration, condition sets of CI tests are constructed from nodes that are within a specified search distance, and the sizes of these condition sets is equal to this search distance. The algorithm then iteratively increases the search distance along with the condition set sizes. Thus, each iteration refines a graph, that was recovered by previous iterations having smaller condition sets -- having a higher statistical power. We demonstrate that our algorithm requires significantly fewer CI tests and smaller condition sets compared to the FCI algorithm. This is evident for both recovering the true underlying graph using a perfect CI oracle, and accurately estimating the graph using limited observed data."

We compare our method with PPO and PPORB, which adopts a rollback clipping method, and prove that our method can conduct more accurate updates at each time step than other PPO methods. Moreover, we show that it outperforms the latest PPO variants on both performance and stability in challenging continuous control tasks."

        "abstract_text": "This work proposes a novel portfolio management technique, the Meta Portfolio Method (MPM), inspired by the successes of meta approaches in the field of bioinformatics and elsewhere. The MPM uses XGBoost to learn how to switch between two risk-based portfolio allocation strategies, the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and more classical Na\\\"ive Risk Parity (NRP). It is demonstrated that the MPM is able to successfully take advantage of the best characteristics of each strategy (the NRP's fast growth during market uptrends, and the HRP's protection against drawdowns during market turmoil). As a result, the MPM is shown to possess an excellent out-of-sample risk-reward profile, as measured by the Sharpe ratio, and in addition offers a high degree of interpretability of its asset allocation decisions."

        "abstract_text": "While parallelism has been extensively used in Reinforcement Learning (RL), the quantitative effects of parallel exploration are not well understood theoretically. We study the benefits of simple parallel exploration for reward-free RL for linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) and two-player zero-sum Markov games (MGs). In contrast to the existing literature focused on approaches that encourage agents to explore over a diverse set of policies, we show that using a single policy to guide exploration across all agents is sufficient to obtain an almost-linear speedup in all cases compared to their fully sequential counterpart. Further, we show that this simple procedure is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors in the reward-free setting for both linear MDPs and two-player zero-sum MGs. From a practical perspective, our paper shows that a single policy is sufficient and provably optimal for incorporating parallelism during the exploration phase."

        "abstract_text": "Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios."

We specially choose this regularization because it is known that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable form in solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMF problem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonov regularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems. The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown to have convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism to automatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, a well-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown in the NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherent problems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergence guarantee and regularization parameters determination."

We transform the discrete 3-axis signals from the motion sensors into a gray-scale image representation which is provided as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained for multi-class user classification. In the pre-training stage, we benefit from different users and multiple samples per user. After pre-training, we use our CNN as feature extractor, generating an embedding associated to each single tap on the screen. The resulting embeddings are used to train a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model in a few-shot user identification setting, i.e. requiring only 20 taps on the screen during the registration phase. We compare our identification system based on CNN features with two baseline systems, one that employs handcrafted features and another that employs recurrent neural network (RNN) features. All systems are based on the same classifier, namely SVM. To pre-train the CNN and the RNN models for multi-class user classification, we use a different set of users than the set used for few-shot user identification, ensuring a realistic scenario. The empirical results demonstrate that our CNN model yields a top accuracy of 89.75% in multi-class user classification and a top accuracy of 96.72% in few-shot user identification. In conclusion, we believe that our system is ready for practical use, having a better generalization capacity than both baselines."

For that purpose, clustered Lasso and octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression (OSCAR) are used to make feature groups automatically by pairwise $L_1$ norm and pairwise $L_\\infty$ norm, respectively. This paper proposes efficient path algorithms for clustered Lasso and OSCAR to construct solution paths with respect to their regularization parameters. Despite too many terms in exhaustive pairwise regularization, their computational costs are reduced by using symmetry of those terms. Simple equivalent conditions to check subgradient equations in each feature group are derived by some graph theories. The proposed algorithms are shown to be more efficient than existing algorithms in numerical experiments."

        "abstract_text": "Objective: Epileptic seizures are relatively common in critically-ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and thus serve as an important target for identification and treatment. Most of these seizures have no discernible clinical manifestation but still have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Children that are deemed at risk for seizures within the PICU are monitored using continuous-electroencephalogram (cEEG). cEEG monitoring cost is considerable and as the number of available machines is always limited, clinicians need to resort to triaging patients according to perceived risk in order to allocate resources. This research aims to develop a computer aided tool to improve seizures risk assessment in critically-ill children, using an ubiquitously recorded signal in the PICU, namely the electrocardiogram (ECG). Approach: A novel data-driven model was developed at a patient-level approach, based on features extracted from the first hour of ECG recording and the clinical data of the patient. Main results: The most predictive features were the age of the patient, the brain injury as coma etiology and the QRS area. For patients without any prior clinical data, using one hour of ECG recording, the classification performance of the random forest classifier reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.84. When combining ECG features with the patients clinical history, the AUROC reached 0.87. Significance: Taking a real clinical scenario, we estimated that our clinical decision support triage tool can improve the positive predictive value by more than 59% over the clinical standard."

Carrying a loop of stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) steps on the (inner) maximization problem, followed by an SGD step on the (outer) minimization, is known as Epoch Stochastic Gradient \\textit{Descent Ascent} (ESGDA). While successful in practice, the theoretical analysis of ESGDA remains challenging, with no clear guidance on choices for the inner loop size nor on the interplay between inner/outer step sizes. We propose RSGDA (Randomized SGDA), a variant of ESGDA with stochastic loop size with a simpler theoretical analysis. RSGDA comes with the first (among SGDA algorithms) almost sure convergence rates when used on nonconvex min/strongly-concave max settings. RSGDA can be parameterized using optimal loop sizes that guarantee the best convergence rates known to hold for SGDA. We test RSGDA on toy and larger scale problems, using distributionally robust optimization and single-cell data matching using optimal transport as a testbed."

An application program to be executed on the SE is represented as a combination of Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) graphs, where every instruction is represented as a node. Each node needs to be mapped to the right slot and array in the SE to ensure the correct execution of the program. This creates an optimization problem with a vast and sparse search space for which finding a mapping manually is impractical because it requires expertise and knowledge of the SE micro-architecture. In this work we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework with Global Graph Attention (GGA) module and output masking of invalid placements to find and optimize instruction schedules. We use Proximal Policy Optimization in order to train a model which places operations into the SE tiles based on a reward function that models the SE device and its constraints. The GGA module consists of a graph neural network and an attention module. The graph neural network creates embeddings of the SDFs and the attention block is used to model sequential operation placement. We show results on how certain workloads are mapped to the SE and the factors affecting mapping quality. We find that the addition of GGA, on average, finds 10% better instruction schedules in terms of total clock cycles taken and masking improves reward obtained by 20%."

These measures can be modeled as random variables and compared among each other via their expected values or more sophisticated tools such as null hypothesis statistical tests. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework to visually compare two samples according to their estimated cumulative distribution functions. First, we introduce a dominance measure for two random variables that quantifies the proportion in which the cumulative distribution function of one of the random variables scholastically dominates the other one. Then, we present a graphical method that decomposes in quantiles i) the proposed dominance measure and ii) the probability that one of the random variables takes lower values than the other. With illustrative purposes, we re-evaluate the experimentation of an already published work with the proposed methodology and we show that additional conclusions (missed by the rest of the methods) can be inferred. Additionally, the software package RVCompare was created as a convenient way of applying and experimenting with the proposed framework."

We call this scheme multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network (MWRDCNN). Compared with other RDB-based networks, it can extract more features of the object from adjacent layers, preserve the large RF, and boost the computing efficiency. Meanwhile, this approach also provides a possibility of absorbing advantages of multiple architectures in a single network without conflicts. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in extensive experiments with a comparison with existing techniques."

For the case of unknown dynamics, we represent all the dynamics with a deep neural network (DNN). When the dynamics of the system are known up to the specification of constitutive relations (that can depend on the state of the system), we represent these constitutive relations with a DNN. The discrete versions combine classical multistep discretization methods for dynamical systems with neural network based machine learning methods. On the other hand, the continuous versions utilize deep neural networks to minimize the residual function for the continuous governing equations. We use the case of a fedbatch bioreactor system to study the effectiveness of these approaches and discuss conditions for their applicability. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the trained neural network models is much higher for the cases where we only have to learn a constitutive relation instead of the whole dynamics. This finding corroborates the well-known fact from scientific computing that building as much structural information is available into an algorithm can enhance its efficiency and/or accuracy."

For example, variational autoencoders with autoregressive decoders often collapse into autodecoders, where they learn to ignore the encoder input. In this work, we demonstrate that adding an auxiliary decoder to regularize the latent space can prevent this collapse, but successful auxiliary decoding tasks are domain dependent. Auxiliary decoders can increase the amount of semantic information encoded in the latent space and visible in the reconstructions. The semantic information in the variational autoencoder's representation is only weakly correlated with its rate, distortion, or evidence lower bound. Compared to other popular strategies that modify the training objective, our regularization of the latent space generally increased the semantic information content."

The regret bounds often rely on the maximal information gain $\\gamma_T$ between $T$ observations and the underlying GP (surrogate) model. We provide general bounds on $\\gamma_T$ based on the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the GP kernel, whose specialisation for commonly used kernels, improves the existing bounds on $\\gamma_T$, and subsequently the regret bounds relying on $\\gamma_T$ under numerous settings. For the Mat\\'ern family of kernels, where the lower bounds on $\\gamma_T$, and regret under the frequentist setting, are known, our results close a huge polynomial in $T$ gap between the upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic in $T$ factors)."

Variability across different depression databases adversely affects the results in cross corpus evaluations (CCEs).

We show that ACFs derived from Vocal Tract Variables (TVs) show promise as a robust set of features for depression detection. Our model achieves relative accuracy improvements of ~10% compared to CCEs performed on models trained on a single database. We extend the study to show that fusing TVs and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients can further improve the performance of this classifier."

These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large datasets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the datasets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using Euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the dataset, insight that can guide further scientific investigation."

The second stage learns the final models using a multi-task classification loss for the source and target domains. Note that the two domains have separate batch normalization layers in both stages. Our framework can be easily incorporated into the domain adaptation techniques based on deep neural networks with batch normalization layers.

Conventional methods of OOD detection perform multi-variate analysis on an ensemble of data or features, and usually resort to the supervision with OOD data to improve the accuracy. In reality, such supervision is impractical as one cannot anticipate the anomalous data. In this paper, we propose a novel, self-supervised approach that does not rely on any pre-defined OOD data: (1) The new method evaluates the Mahalanobis distance of the gradients between the in-distribution and OOD data. (2) It is assisted by a self-supervised binary classifier to guide the label selection to generate the gradients, and maximize the Mahalanobis distance. In the evaluation with multiple datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and TinyImageNet, the proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) metrics.
